 活动介绍： 报告题目:Smart Home Cybersecurity: Threat and Defense         in a Cyber-Physical System报告人: Professor Shiyan Hu 时间: 2016年3月16日下午 2:00 地点: 软件所5号楼四层中会议室    报告内容: The massive deployment of advanced metering infrastructure and home energy management system has mandated a transformative shift of the classical grid into a more reliable and secure grid. The smart home system is critical in this infrastructure as it controls the end usecomponents of a grid. Despite its importance, such a system is vulnerable to variouscyberattacks such as energy theft and pricing hack. In this talk, I will describe several of ourrecent works on smart home cyberthreat analysis and defense technology development. I willfirst show that due to the interdependence between utility pricing and customer energy load, anattacker could tamper smart meters for electricity bill increase and energy load unbalancing, and similarly energy theft could potentially disturb the power system. I will then discuss someadvanced control theoretic and algorithmic techniques developed in my group to defend againstthose cyberattacks, including partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) based detection and cross entropy optimization based Feeder Remote Terminal Unit (FRTU) deployment. I will conclude the talk with some of the ongoing research conducted in my group and our international collaborators.   报告人简介: Professor Shiyan Hu received his Ph.D. in Computer Engineering from Texas A&M University in 2008.
