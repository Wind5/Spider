 Title: Full Abstraction for a Probabilistic Functional Programming LanguageSpeaker: Thomas Ehrhard (CNRS-Paris Diderot University, France)    　　www.pps.univ-paris-diderot.fr/~ehrhardTime: 28th October 2014, 15:00Venue: Seminar Room (334), Level 3, Building 5, Institute of Software, CASAbstract:We introduce a probabilistic version of Plotkin's PCF, a paradigmatic functional programming language. We also describe a denotational model for this language, based on probabilistic coherence spaces, and we prove adequacy and full abstraction for this interpretation, introducing an innovative method. This is a joint work with C. Tasson and M. Pagani, published in POPL'4.Biography:Thomas Ehrhard is a former student of Ecole Polytechnique, he obtained his PhD and Habilitation a Diriger les Recherches from Univ. Paris 7, in Computer Science. He is CNRS Senior Researcher since 2001 and the Director of the PPS Lab (Proofs, Programs and Systems), Univ. Paris 7, CNRS and INRIA. He is an expert in proof theory and semantics of programming languages. He has been member of the program committees of international conferences such as LICS, ICALP etc. He is the head of the Univ. Paris 7 site of the French-Chinese cooperation project Locali.
