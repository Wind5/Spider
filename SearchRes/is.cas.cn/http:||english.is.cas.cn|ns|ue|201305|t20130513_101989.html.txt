Automata over infinite alphabets provide a formalism for the theoretical study of processes working with unbounded data. However, infinite sets of data come with a high price: even limited expressiveness leads to high complexity of decision algorithms. In this context, we propose a class of automata for counting the multiplicity of occurrences of data in words and show that emptiness is elementarily decidable. While we do not have a logical characterization for these automata, we discuss results on related logics.
The work presented here is joint with Amaldev Manuel (LIAFA, Paris).
