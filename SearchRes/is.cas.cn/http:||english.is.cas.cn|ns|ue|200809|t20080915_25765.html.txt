 [9-17]Belief Revision in Description Logics and Its Application to the Semantic Web 
 Title: Belief Revision in Description Logics and Its Application to the Semantic Web Speaker：Dr. Guilin Qi （University of Karlsruhe ）Time：10:00am, Wednesday Sept 17 Venue: Lecture room, Lab for Computer Science, Level 3 Building #5 Abstract: Intelligent agents frequently face the problem of incorporating beliefs or knowledge from a new source of Information in a consistent way. This problem is called belief revision and is considered as one of the central problems in Artificial Intelligence. In this talk, I will give an overview of current approaches to applying the theory of belief revision to Description Logics, which provide logical underpinning for web ontology language OWL, and discuss how it can be used to deal with practical problems on the Semantic Web. At the end of this talk, I will give some insights on the future directions of this topic.
