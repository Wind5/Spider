 Title：Organizational Volatility and Developer Productivity Speaker：Dr. Audris Mockus, Research scientist of Avaya Labs Research 
Venue：Lecture room, State Key Lab of Computer Science, Level 3 Building #5
Abstract: The key premise of an organization is to allow more efficient production, including production of software. To achieve that, an organization defines roles and reporting relationships. Therefore, changes in organizations structure are likely to affect organizations productivity. We investigate several measures of organization and organizational change and relate them to developer productivity. We find that the proximity to an organizational change is strongly associated with a reduced developer productivity.
