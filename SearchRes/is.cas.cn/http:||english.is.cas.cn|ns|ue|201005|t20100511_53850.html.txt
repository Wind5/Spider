 Title: Improving Software Quality with ParfaitSpeaker: Cristina Cifuentes (Sun Labs, Oracle)Time:  14:00, Wed. May 12, 2010.Venue: Lecture room, Lab for Computer Science, Level 3 Building #5, Institute of Software, CASAbstract:Parfait is a static bug-checking tool for C/C++ source code, designed to be both scalable and precise.  Internally at Sun various software organizations are using Parfait to analyse thousands to millions of lines of code, with over 500 buffer overflows found and fixed. Assisted by its graphical web-based user interface, both developers and managers are able to traverse bug data in a quick and easy way. In this talk I will give an overview of Parfait's design and implementation, show results over the Solaris code base in terms of accuracy and performance of the tool, and give a demo using the Solaris results.Bio:Dr Cristina Cifuentes is a Senior Principal Engineer and a Senior Research Manager with Sun Labs at Oracle.
