 One of the major goals of ISCAS is to provide the society with highly qualified researchers and software engineers, through its education system. ISCAS is proud to have a number of senior researchers who are pioneers in software development and computer science research in China. They are innovative, rigorous and hard working. They have strong influence on the younger generation. Like other institutes of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, ISCAS does not have undergraduate students. Graduate students may take the following programs:　　* Ph.D. in computer science　　* Master in computer science　　The degrees are officially offered by the Graduate School of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (GSCAS: http://www.gscas.ac.cn)　　A student with a Bachelor’s degree usually needs 3 years to get a master’s degree or 5 to 6 years to get a Ph.D. degree, while a student with a Master’s degree needs 3 to 4 years to obtain a Ph.D. degree. A student without a Master’s degree usually has to spend the first year taking courses at the main campus of GSCAS.　　The number of graduate students keeps growing through the years, as shown by the following table.
