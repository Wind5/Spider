 The Lab for Internet Software Technologies (iTechs), the Institute of Software, Chinese Academy of Sciences (ISCAS), was established in 2001. iTechs was evolved from the joint Lab for Advanced Software Technology which was founded in 1999. iTechs is mainly engaged in the research and development of Internet software technology with Intelligent Software Engineering and Real-Time System as the major fields. Since its establishment, iTechs has undertaken a number of key national research projects in China and cooperative projects with other countries. With a stable and high-quality research team, iTechs has gained exciting achievements and taken a good momentum for further development. In 2005, Integrated Software Process Services Technology and Management System won the second prize of National Award for Science and Technology Progress.
At the end of 2006, there were 108 regular members in iTechs, including 8 research professors, associate research professors and senior engineers, 21 assistant research fellows and software engineers, 31 Ph.D students (including 2 Ph.D students from Pakistan) and 41 M.S students. Also, 1 post-doctor finished his research work in our lab and 23 students graduated (9 Ph.D students, 12 M.S students, 2 West Scholarship holders). 
The culture that iTechs continuously advocates is to let everyone make the best use of his/her wisdom, let every resource be ultimately used, let every talent realize his/her maximum value.
