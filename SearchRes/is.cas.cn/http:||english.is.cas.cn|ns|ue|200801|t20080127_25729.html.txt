Abstract：This is our approach for reachability analysis for systems with continuous spaces.  We have a working implementation of the "projectagon" methods that Ian Mitchell and I proposed in some of the early HSCC workshops.  While the approach is mathematically simple, the numerical methods  suffered from problems of severe ill conditioning.  We have now tamed those.  Weve applied our prototype tool to verify a toggle flip-flop circuit (seven dimensional, non-linear, ODE model) and are currently working on other circuits.We could also describe related work weve done for analysing synchronizer failure probabilities, noise-margin analysis, and verifying start-up conditions for ring oscillator circuits.
