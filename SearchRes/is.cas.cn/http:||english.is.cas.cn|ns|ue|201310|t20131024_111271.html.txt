 [11-1] The Role of Empirical Studies in Software Engineering 
 Title: The Role of Empirical Studies in Software EngineeringSpeaker: Dietmar PfahlTime: 10am, Friday Nov 1Venue: Lecture Room, 3rd Floor, Building #5, State Key Laboratory of Computer Science, Institute of Software, CAS.Abstract:The presentation gives a brief introduction into empirical research and discusses its importance for software engineering. Recently published studies are used to illustrate how empirical research helps analyse the effectiveness and efficiency of software engineering tools and techniques, and how empirical studies contribute to the design of new techniques and tools and the development of supporting theories.Biography:Dietmar Pfahl is an Associate Professor of the Software Engineering Group in the Institute of Computer Science at the University of Tartu, Estonia.
