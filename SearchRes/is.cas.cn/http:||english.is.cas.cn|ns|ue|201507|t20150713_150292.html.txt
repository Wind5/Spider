 　　Title：Visual Analytics of Big Complex Networks　　Speaker：Seokhee Hong　　Affiliation)：University of Sydney　　Venue: Room 334, Level 3, Building 5,  Institute of Software, CAS　　Time：2015-7-16 2:00PM　　http://www.iscas.ac.cn/qnlhh/xsqy/201507/t20150713_4391764.html 　　Abstract：　　Recent technological advances have led to big complex network models in many domains, including social networks and biological networks. Good visualisation can reveal the hidden structure of the networks and amplifies human understanding, thus leading to new insights and findings. However, visualisation of massive complex networks is challenging due to scalability and complexity. This talk will address the challenging issues for visual analytics of big complex networks, and review latest methods for visual analytics of such networks.  　　  Biography：　　SeokHee Hong is a professor and a Future Fellow at the University of Sydney.
