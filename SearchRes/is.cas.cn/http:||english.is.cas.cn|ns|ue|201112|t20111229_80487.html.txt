 [2012-1-5] Degrees of non- determinacy of computable games and linear logic 
Speaker: Mr. Zhenhao Li (Phd Student, ILLC, University of Amsterdam, Netherlands)
Venue: Lecture Room, Level 3, Building No. 5, State Key Laboratory of Computer Science, Institute of Software, Chinese Academy of Science. 
There are many interesting families of two-player, win-lose games of perfect information which contain undetermined games. Blass introduced an algebra structure and a reducibility relation on the family of infinite games. The concept of his algebra and reducibility relation is general and powerful. Via each family of games into degrees of non-determinacy. The degrees of non-determinacy of infinite games provide a semantics to linear logic. I will give a very brief overview about game semantics, linear logic and degrees of non-determinacy, and talk about the connection between degrees of non-determinacy of computable games and linear logic and related open questions.
Zhenhao Li earned a BEng in Software Engineering in Northeast Normal University in 2009. Then he moved to Amsterdam where he got an MSc in Logic after studying two years in the University of Amsterdam. He is currently a PhD student in Amsterdam under the supervision of Benedikt Lowe. He has published work in Software engineering but his current work focuses the more theoretical topic of games in set theory and computability theory. He investigates a variety of reducibility relations on certain families of games, the resulting degree structures, and the logics generated. In particular, he is interested in the degree structures of computable games and the consequences on set theory, computability theory and complexity theory.
