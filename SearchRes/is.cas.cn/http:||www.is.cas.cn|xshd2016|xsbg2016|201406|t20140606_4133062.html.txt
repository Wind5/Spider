 Title: Program Structure-Aware Fault LocalizationSpeaker: Zhenyu Zhang (Inst. of Software, CAS)        lcs.ios.ac.cn/~zhangzyLanguage: Chinese (English, if 3+ requests)Time: 09:00, June 11th 2014Venue: ROOM 337, 3rd Floor, Building #5, State Key Laboratory of Computer Science, Institute of Software, Chinese Academy of SciencesAbstract:Testing is always an effective method to show the presence of faults(bugs) in programs. When failures are revealed in testing, a debugging process follows typically, which includes locating the fault, fixing the fault, and validating the fix. Fault localization techniques are proposed to automate the first but most time-consuming step. They collect execution statistics from passed runs and failed runs, and analyze them to estimate the suspicious program region. Realizing that the execution statistics, e.g., coverage information, correlate highly with program structure and thus determined program logics, we vouch for the situation that the suspiciousness of program elements are not accurately assessed by existing fault localization techniques. In this talk, we propose our last progress on reduction of version-independent noise caused by program structure in the fault localization tasks of a software developing scenario.
