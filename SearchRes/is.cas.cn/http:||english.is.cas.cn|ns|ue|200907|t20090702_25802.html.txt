 Title：Cubature Formulas with Few Knots Speaker：Prof. Yuan Xu (徐源), Department of Mathematics, University of Oregon Time：10:00－11:30 am, Friday, July 3Venue：Room 337 About the speaker：
(Prof. Yuan Xu, Ph. D., Temple University, 1988) Prof. Xus research spans numerical analysis, approximation theory,special functions,harmonic analysis. His interest is mostly on problems in several variables, such as orthogonal polynomials in several variables, cubature formulas and related approximation problems. Recently his interest also extends to computer tomography. Prof. Xu is now on the editorial board of East J. on Approximations, J. Approximation Theory and Numerical Algorithm. He is an executive editor of Numerical Mathematics: Theory, Methods and Applications. Up to present, Prof. Xu has published 2 books and more than 170 papers. Besides, he has got 7 patents.
