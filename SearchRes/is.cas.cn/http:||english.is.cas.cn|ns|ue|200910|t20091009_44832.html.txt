 [9-23]Mobility in Ad Hoc Wireless Networks: Friend or Foe 
Ad hoc wireless networks are operated in multiple hops in which mobile nodes cooperate to maintain network connectivity. These networks perform various functions, including routing. In this presentation, two opposing views of mobility in ad hoc wireless networks are presented. One view casts mobility as an undesirable feature. This view normally represents ad hoc wireless network as a connected graph where path information needs to be maintained to ensure message delivery. Another view considers mobility as a desirable feature which can be increase network capacity and even assist the routing process. We offer our views on these two approaches and discuss some recent discoveries regarding mobility-mitigation mechanisms and mobility-assisted routing.
