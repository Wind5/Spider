  Title： Global Structure-from-Motion and Its ApplicationSpeaker：Zhaopeng Cui, Simon Fraser University and ETH ZurichTime： 9:30 am, September 5, 2017Venue：Middle Meeting Room, Floor 4, Building 5, Institute of SoftwareAbstractStructure-from-motion (SfM) is a fundamental problem in 3D computer vision, with the aim of recovering camera poses and 3D scene structure simultaneously given a set of 2D images. SfM methods can be broadly divided into incremental and global methods according to their ways to register cameras. Incremental methods register cameras one by one, while global SfM methods solve all cameras simultaneously from all available relative motions. As a result, global SfM has better potential in both reconstruction accuracy and computation efficiency than incremental SfM. In this talk, I will present our latest global SfM system which could deal with all kinds of camera motions and datasets. Then I will present our new robust video alignment algorithm based on global SfM, which can align videos taken at different times with substantially different appearances. At last, I will briefly discuss some other applications with SfM as well as the future work. BioZhaopeng Cui has just completed his Ph.D. at Simon Fraser University (SFU), and will be a postdoctoral researcher at ETH Zurich in September, 2017.Before joining SFU, he was a Ph.D. candidate at National University of Singapore. He received his B.Sc. (2009) and his M.Sc. (2012) from Xidian University.His research interests are concentrated in 3D computer vision and computer graphics, more specifically, in large-scale image-based 3D reconstruction,video editing, multi-view stereo and SLAM. All are welcome!
