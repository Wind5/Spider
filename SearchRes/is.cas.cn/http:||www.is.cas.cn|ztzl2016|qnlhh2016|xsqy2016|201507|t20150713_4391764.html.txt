 　　活动介绍：   　　报告题目: Visual Analytics Of Big Complex Networks　　            　　报告人: Seok-Hee Hong教授　　时间: 2015年7月16日下午02:00  　　地点: 软件所5号楼334会议室  报告内容:                  Recent technological advances have led to big complex network models in many domains, including social networks and biological networks. Good visualisation can reveal the hidden structure of networks and amplifies human understanding, thus leading to new insights and findings. However, visualisation of massive complex networks is challenging due to scalability and complexity. This talk will address the challenging issues for visual analytics of big complex networks, and review latest methods for visual analytics of such networks.　　报告人简介:                 Seok-Hee Hong is a professor and a Future Fellow at the University of Sydney.
