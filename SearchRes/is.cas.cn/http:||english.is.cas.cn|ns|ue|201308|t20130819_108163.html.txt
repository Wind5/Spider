 [8-20] Text entry methods for touch screen and pen-based devices 
 Title: Text entry methods for touch screen and pen-based devicesSpeaker: Gennaro Costagliola (University of Salerno, Italy)Time: 10:00am, August 20th, 2013Venue: Lecture Room, 3rd Floor, Building #5, State Key Laboratory of Computer Science, Institute of Software, Chinese Academy of SciencesAbstract: In this talk, I will go through the principal methods for the text entry on devices such as smart phones and tablets by taking into account fingers and styluses. I will show the problems to face, some simulation models and the techniques needed to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of a text entry method. Finally, as a case study, I will present a comparison between the methods KeyScretch and Shapewriter.Bio: Prof. Gennaro Costagliola received his Laurea degree in Computer Science magna cum laude from the University of Salerno, Italy, in 1987. From 1989 to 1993 he was a post-graduate and a visiting researcher at the University of Pittsburgh, PA, USA and then joined the Faculty of Science at the University of Salerno as an Assistant Professor. Since 2001 he has been a Full Professor of Computer Science at the University of Salerno and Director of the Web Technologies and e-Learning Lab. His research interests include the theory, implementation, and applications of visual languages, human-computer interaction, web engineering and e-learning leading to more than one hundred of published papers.He is a member of the Association for Computing Machinery since 1992 and IEEE Computer Society since 1991.He is a member of the Steering Committee of the IEEE Symposium on Visual Languages and Human-Centric Computing and the organizer of the yearly special session on Sketch Computation at the Visual Language Computing international workshop.
