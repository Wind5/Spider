In this seminar we explore some issues related to signal detection in wireless sensor networks (WSNs). First, a brief overview is provided for the conventional detection problems. Then, the detection strategies in WSNs are addressed in the context of two types of WSN modes, which are the double-layer WSNs and triple-layer WSNs. Finally, some observations are summarized and further research issues are discussed.
Dr. Lie-Liang Yang（杨烈亮） received his BEng degree in communication engineering from Shanghai TieDao University, Shanghai, China in 1988, and his MEng and PhD. degrees in communications and electronics from Beijing (Northern) Jiaotong University, Beijing, China in 1991 and 1997, respectively. From June 1997 to December 1997 he was a visiting scientist of the Institute of Radio Engineering and Electronics, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic. Since December 1997, he has been with the Communications Research Group, School of Electronics and Computer Science, University of Southampton, U.K, where he was first a Postdoctoral Research Fellow (Dec. 1997 - Aug. 2002), then a Lecturer (Sept. 2002 - Feb. 2006), and currently holds the academic post of Readership. Dr. Yangs research has covered a wide range of topics in wireless communications, networking and signal processing. He has published over 200 papers in journals and conference proceedings, authored/coauthored two book and also published several book chapters.  He was awarded the Royal Society Sino-British Fellowship in 1997 and the EPNeedDownload="true" SRC Research Fellowship in 1998. Dr. Yang is currently an associate editor for both the Journal of Communications and Networks (JCN) and the Journal of Communications (JCM).
