The 8th IEEE eScience conference (e-Science 2012), sponsored by the IEEE Computer Society's Technical Committee for Scalable Computing (TCSC), will be held in Chicago Illinois from 8-12th October 2012. The eScience 2011 conference is designed to bring together leading international and interdisciplinary research communities, developers, and users of eScience applications and enabling IT technologies.
Multiple e-Science 2012 Workshops will be held on Monday and Tuesday, 8th and 9th October, colocated with the main conference. 
Workshops are an important part of the conference in providing opportunity for researchers to present their work in a more focused way than the conference itself and to have discussion of particular topics of interest to the community. We cordially invite you to submit workshop proposals on any eScience related topic to the Workshop Chair.
To help those interested know their purpose and scope, workshop proposals should include: 
 • A description of the workshop, its focus, goals, and outcome
 • Names and affiliations of the organizers and tentative composition of the committees
 • Prior history of this workshop, if any. Please include: number of submissions, number of accepted papers, and attendee count.
Workshop organizers are responsible for establishing a program committee, collecting and evaluating submissions, notifying authors of acceptance or rejection in due time, ensuring a transparent and fair selection process, organizing selected papers into sessions, and assigning session chairs. Proposals will be selected that show clear focus and objectives in areas of emerging or developing interest guaranteed to generate significant interest in the community.
Once accepted, the workshop should establish its own paper submission system. For each paper selected for publication, an author must be registered for eScience 2012. Each paper must be presented in person by at least one of the authors. It is expected that the proceedings of the eScience 2012 workshops will be published by the IEEE Computer Society Press, USA and will be made available online through the IEEE Digital Library.
While it is up to the workshop organizers to work with the authors of any papers to be published from the workshop presenters, it should be noted that information about these will be needed by 27th August 2012 and final camera ready papers are needed by 17th September 2012.
Researchers in all disciplines are increasingly adopting digital tools, techniques and practices, often in communities and projects that span disciplines, laboratories, organizations, and national boundaries. The eScience 2012 conference is designed to bring together leading international and interdisciplinary research communities, developers, and users of eScience applications and enabling IT technologies. The conference serves as a forum to present the results of the latest applications research and product/tool developments and to highlight related activities from around the world. Also, we are now entering the second decade of eScience and the 2012 conference gives an opportunity to take stock of what has been achieved so far and look forward to the challenges and opportunities the next decade will bring.
A special emphasis of the 2012 conference is on advances in the application of technology in a particular discipline. Accordingly, significant advances in applications science and technology will be considered as important as the development of new technologies themselves. Further, we welcome contributions in educational activities under any of these disciplines.
As a result, the conference will be structured around two e-Science tracks:
The conference proceedings will be published by the IEEE Computer Society Press, USA and will be made available online through the IEEE Digital Library. Selected papers will be invited to submit extended versions to a special issue of the Future Generation Computer Systems (FGCS)journal.
Authors are invited to submit papers with unpublished, original work of not more than 8 pages of double column text using single spaced 10 point size on 8.5 x 11 inch pages, as per IEEE 8.5 x 11 manuscript guidelines. (Up to 2 additional pages may be purchased for US$150/page)
Authors should submit a PDF file that will print on a PostScript printer to https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=escience2012
(Note that paper submitters also must submit an abstract in advance of the paper deadline. This shouldbe done through the same site where papers are submitted.) 
It is a requirement that at least one author of each accepted paper attend the conference.
