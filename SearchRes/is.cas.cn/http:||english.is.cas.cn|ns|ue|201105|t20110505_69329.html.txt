Abstract：In this talk we address the challenge of enforcing security policies in a distributed setting. We show how techniques from aspect-oriented programming can be integrated in a coordination approach to system specification thereby providing a clear separation between the functionality and the security policies of programs. Allowing for a distributed definition of advices, that jointly define a security policy, provide for a number of challenges regarding how to deal with conflicts and how to demonstrate that an overall security policy is met. We adapt a rich set of policy composition operators originating from Belnap Logic to provide a uniform treatment of conflicts. We extend the approach to enforcing security policies in a settings involving humans and where a determined attacker always has a chance of circumventing any security. For this we introduce a probabilistic version of Belnap logic and the formalisation of the semantics now gives rise to Markov Decision Processes. We motivate our approach by two examples: a health care scenario and an airport security system. This is joint work with Flemming Nielson (DTU) and Chris Hankin (ICL).
