 *************** 　 CALL FOR PAPERS 　 *************** 　 ================================================ 　　　　Eighth IEEE Workshop on　High-Performance, Power-Aware Computing (HP-PAC) 　　　May 21, 2012 　to be held in conjunction with IPDPS 　May 21 - 25, 2012 　Shanghai, China 　 ================================================ 
SCOPE ----- 　High-performance computing is and has always been performance-oriented. 　However, a consequence of the push towards maximum performance is 　increased energy consumption, especially in datacenters and 　supercomputing centers.　Moreover, as peak performance is rarely 　attained, some of this energy consumption results in little or no 　performance gain.　In addition, large energy consumption costs 　datacenters and supercomputing centers a significant amount of 　money and wastes natural resources. 　The main goal of this workshop is to provide a timely forum for the 　exchange and dissemination of new ideas, techniques, and research in 　high-performance, power-aware computing (HPPAC).　HPPAC will present 　research that reduces (1) power consumption, (2) energy consumption, 　or (3) heat generation with little or no performance penalty in 　high-performance computing systems.　In effect, the workshop aims to 　move towards "greener" solutions for datacenters and supercomputing 　centers. 　Topics of interest include but are not limited to the following. 　. Novel power-aware architectures for HPC 　. Power-aware middleware for HPC 　. Power-aware runtime systems for HPC 　. Reduced power/energy/heat algorithms & applications 　. Surveys or studies of power/energy/heat usage of HPC applications and systems PROCEEDINGS ----------- 　The proceedings of this workshop will be published together with 　the proceedings of other IPDPS '10 workshops by the IEEE Computer 　Society Press. PAPER SUBMISSIONS ----------------- 　All papers should not exceed 8 single-spaced, double column pages (US Letter) 　in 11pt font. All papers will be reviewed. Accepted papers will appear in 　the printed program book and CD-ROM proceedings of the main conference, 　IPDPS2012. The submission site will be available soon. IMPORTANT DATES --------------- 　Paper submission: 13 January　2012 at 11:59PM EST 　Author notification: 6 February 2012 　Camera-ready due: 21 February 2012 WORKSHOP CO-CHAIRS ------------------ 　Bronis R. de Supinski, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, USA 　Roberto Gioiosa, Barcelona Supercomputing Center, Spain PUBLICITY CHAIR ------------------ 　Yunquan Zhang, Chinese Academy of Sciences, China PROGRAM COMMITTEE ----------------- 　Frank Bellosa, University of Karlsruhe 　Taisuke Boku, University of Tsukuba 　Laura Carrington, San Diego Supercomputer Center 　Marco Cesati, University of Rome "Tor Vergata" 　Canturk Isci, IBM 　Rong Ge, Marquette University 　Rob Knauerhase, Intel Labs 　Laurent Lefevre, INRIA and University of Lyon 　Dong Li, Oak Ridge National Laboratory 　David Lowenthal, University of Arizona 　Naoya Maruyama, Tokyo Institute of Technology 　Sally McKee, Chalmers Univesrity 　Tali Moreshet, Swarthmore College 　Hiroshi Nakashima, Kyoto University 　Ripal Nathuji, Microsoft 　Suzanne Rivoire, Sonoma State University CONTACT INFO ------------ web: http://hppac12.ac.upc.edu 　email: roberto.gioiosa -at- bsc.es
