2nd International Workshop on Software Engineering for Embedded Systems (SEES 2012)
With the proliferation of embedded ubiquitous systems in all aspects of human life, the embedded systems world has become a fast growing industry. Embedded systems have to rely on high quality hardware as well as high quality software. Software development for embedded systems is often a complex undertaking and fundamentally different from that of non-embedded systems. Complexity arises from the need to co-design and create software at low-level of abstraction that also interacts closely with hardware, and with strong emphasis on dependability and mission-critical real-time constraints. Compared to traditional software development, the increasing complexity also exacerbates challenges in embedded software development processes, such as trouble in achieving sufficient product quality and timely delivery. In order to tackle these challenges in embedded software development, industry needs to apply software engineering technologies that are appropriate for specific situations.
The SEES 2012 workshop aims to provide researchers and practitioners an international forum to discuss the issues and challenges in adopting software engineering methods for embedded systems development.
The workshop seeks research and experience from both academia and industry that address the questions like
• What is the state-of-the-practice of software engineering methods for embedded systems development?
• What are the challenges of adopting software engineering technologies in embedded systems development?
• What are the limitations and opportunities of the current software engineering research for embedded systems development?
To be specific, the workshop’s topics of interest include, but are not limited to:
• Formal approaches (e.g., formal methods and static analysis) for embedded systems verification;
• Antônio Augusto Fröhlich, Federal University of Santa Catarina , Brazil
The workshop invites both research papers (maximum length 7 pages) and position papers (maximum length 3 pages). All submissions must conform at time of submission to the ICSE 2012 Format and Submission Guidelines (http://www.ifi.uzh.ch/icse2012/how-to-submit/) in PDF format. The workshop proceedings will be included in the ICSE 2012 electronic proceedings collection.
For further information regarding the workshop and paper submission, please refer to the SEES 2012 website at http://www.ssrg.nicta.com.au/sees12/ (or workshops page at ICSE 2012 website http://www.ifi.uzh.ch/icse2012/program/workshops/workshops-details/#c340) that will be regularly updated.
