Abstract:This talk addresses the challenges to establish not only a common terminology but also a common understanding of concepts in general and of those in the RAMS in railways-domain in particular. To overcome the identified obstacles, it is proposed to use the iGLOSS-approach (iGLOSS – intelligent glossary) as an appropriate means to support the common way of standardisation. In addition, the general process of standardization is described as a long lasting and laborious project. The revision of the CENELEC 5012x-norms and an approach to improve these is outlined. The talk finishes with a characterization of the benefits of standards.
