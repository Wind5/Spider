 To promote cooperation and exchanges in the field of research on trustworthy software systems, the second ISCAS/USC/UMass Joint Workshop was held in June 3-4, 2009, at ISCAS, Beijing.
The theme of the Joint Workshop is Trustworthy Software Systems, focusing on the development, service and evolution of trustworthy software. The workshop is sponsored by ISCAS-iTechs. Prof. Mingshu Li, Director of ISCAS, gave a warm welcome to all attendees at the beginning of the workshop. Prof. Qing Wang, Director of iTechs, gave a speech by summarizing the achievements of iTechs Joint Laboratories with UCS and UMASS since last workshop.
Members of the joint laboratory, Prof. Barry Boehm from USC-CSSE (University of Southern California, Center for Systems and Software Engineering), Prof. Leon. Osterweil and Prof. Lori Clarke from UMass-LASER (University of Massachusetts Amherst, Laboratory for Advanced Software Engineering Research), gave keynote addresses at the workshop. They talked about the Economics of Software Quality, Precise Process Definition and Process Analysis Techniques, respectively. Research faculty and students from iTechs introduced their latest research work on the trustworthy software process, requirement engineering, software estimation, software process modeling and formal verification and so on. In addition, 6 researchers from Tsinghua Univ., Wuhan University, Beihang University, CoreTek Systems, GUCAS, NUDT, and USC-CSSE were also invited to give talks and share their latest research on trustworthy software systems.
The workshop set up an international exchange platform for domestic and foreign counterparts. Everybody attended the meeting learned a lot. We look forward the next workshop.
