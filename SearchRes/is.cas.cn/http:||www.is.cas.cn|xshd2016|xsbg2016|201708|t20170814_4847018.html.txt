In particular, I will talk about secure deep learning and challenges and approaches to ensure the integrity of decisions made by deep learning. I will also give an overview on our work on using program analysis and transformation techniques to enable privacy-preserving data analytics and machine learning. I will also talk about how we can use deep learning for vulnerability detection. Finally, I will conclude with future directions at the intersection of AI and Security.  个人介绍:  　　Dawn Song is a Professor in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at UC Berkeley. Her research interest lies in deep learning and security. She has studied diverse security and privacy issues in computer systems and networks, including areas ranging from software security, networking security, database security, distributed systems security, applied cryptography, to the intersection of machine learning and security. She is the recipient of various awards including the MacArthur Fellowship, the Guggenheim Fellowship, the NSF CAREER Award, the Alfred P. Sloan Research Fellowship, the MIT Technology Review TR-35 Award, the George Tallman Ladd Research Award, the Okawa Foundation Research Award, the Li KaShing Foundation Women in Science Distinguished Lecture Series Award, the Faculty Research Award from IBM, Google and other major tech companies, and Best Paper Awards from top conferences. She obtained her Ph.D. degree from UC Berkeley. Prior to joining UC Berkeley as a faculty, she was a faculty at Carnegie Mellon University from 2002 to 2007.  Chengyu Song博士，加州大学河滨分校   题目: Efficient Protection of Path-Sensitive Control Security  摘要: 　　Control-Flow Integrity (CFI), as a means to prevent control-flowhijacking attacks, enforces that each instruction transfers control toan address in a set of valid targets.  The security guarantee of CFIthus depends on the definition of valid targets, which conventionallyare defined as the result of a static analysis.  Unfortunately, previousresearch has demonstrated that such a definition, and thus anyimplementation that enforces it, still allows practical control-flowattacks. 　　In this work, we present a path-sensitive variation of CFI that utilizesruntime path-sensitive point-to analysis to compute the legitimatecontrol transfer targets.  We have designed and implemented a runtimeenvironment, PittyPat, that enforces path-sensitive CFI efficiently bycombining commodity, low-overhead hardware monitoring and a novelruntime points-to analysis.  Our formal analysis and empiricalevaluation demonstrate that, compared to CFI based on static analysis,PittyPat ensures that applications satisfy stronger security guarantees,with acceptable overhead for security-critical contexts.  个人介绍: 　　Chengyu Song is an Assistant Professor at the Computer Science andEngineering department of UC Riverside. His primary research interestsare system and software security. He received his PhD from Georgia Techsupervised by Prof. Wenke Lee and Prof. Taesoo Kim. He has published14 papers in top security and system conferences. One of his co-authoredpaper won the 2015 Internet defense prize ($100k) and another one wonthe CSAW'15 best applied security research paper. He received his M.Eng.and B.S. from Peking University in 2010 and 2007.
