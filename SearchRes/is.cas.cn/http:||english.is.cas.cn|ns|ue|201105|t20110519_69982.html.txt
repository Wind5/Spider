 [5-17]Optimization methods in software project planning and project management 
Venue: Lecture Room, Level 3, Building No. 5, State Key Laboratory of Computer Science, ISCAS
Software projects are performed in the presence of resources, time and quality objectives and constraints. Understanding, modeling and solving these problems using optimization helps to find good or very good project strategies. Moreover, the likely impact of these strategies will be known upfront. This knowledge facilitates decisions-making and thus improves project performance. In this talk, an outline on the usage of optimization methods in software engineering decision support is given. Second, this approach is instantiated by two sample areas of research being software release planning and resource allocation and staffing for software projects. In both cases, formulations are given allowing the usage of powerful optimization methods such as linear, integer and genetic programming. Results from empirical evaluations are reported as well.
Dr. Ruhe holds an Industrial Research Chair in Software Engineering at University of Calgary. This is a joint position between department of Computer Science and department of Electrical and Computer Engineering. Dr. Ruhe is proud to lead a research team whose primary aim is to establish and demonstrate scientific excellence in the area of software engineering decision support and to collaborate with industry. The area of research is highly relevant, because software and systems decisions are of paramount importance for success in business today.
Dr. Ruhe has organized different international conferences and workshops, has given keynotes at various conferences and is a reviewer for a couple of journals in software engineering, computer science and operations research. He has published more than 155 reviewed research papers at journals, workshops and conferences.
