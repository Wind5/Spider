 [4-25]A Controlled Experiment on Software Documentation Benefits and Cost 
Title:  A Controlled Experiment on Software Documentation Benefits and Cost
Software documentation is an integral part of any software development process. In practice, software companies and developers often invest time and efforts on writing and maintaining documentation artifacts besides software systems. Researchers and practitioners need to assess whether documentation cost outweighs its benefit.
In this study, we attempt to evaluate the costs and benefits of documentation on aiding software maintenance tasks through a controlled experiment. 26 student subjects were recruited from iTechs Lab, ISCAS.  The subjects were partitioned into two groups.  One group had only the source code while the other had both source code and documentation available.  Each subject was asked to perform a maintenance task individually on a given legacy system. The performance aspects that we were interested in include: (1) task duration, (2) task completion percentage and (3) design consistency with the legacy system.  The talk will focus the interesting findings about the experiment.
