In the past several years, there are quite a few complexity dichotomy theorems for counting problems classes of #CSP, counting graph homomorphisms, and Holant problems. We introduce three of them and compare them in a general counting problem notation #F|G.
We also introduce one important method in this area, Valiant's holographic reduction, and how it stimulates the study of Holant problems.
