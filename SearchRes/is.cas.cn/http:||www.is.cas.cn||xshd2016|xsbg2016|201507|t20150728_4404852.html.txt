 SKLCS Seminar Title: Learning Representation for Fine-Grained Text AnalysisSpeaker:  Lizhen Qu (Macquarie University, Australia)           people.mpi-inf.mpg.de/~lquTime: 31st July 2015, 15:00Venue: Seminar Room (334), Level 3, Building 5,        Institute of Software, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS),        4 Zhongguancun South Fourth Street, Haidian District, Beijing 100190 Abstract:My talk will consist of two parts. In the first part of the talk Iwill present Senti-LSSVM model for sentiment-oriented relationextraction.  This task aims to jointly extract both sentiments (e.g.Paul likes Nexus 5.) and comparisons (e.g. Paul thinks Nexus 5 isbetter than Galaxy S5.) from sentences. The corresponding outputs aredirected hyper-graphs and the lexical features are learned withrecursive neural networks. In the second part, I will introduce my recent work at NICTA onapplying deep learning techniques to a number of natural languageprocessing tasks, including identification of multi-word expressions,named entity recognition, part-of-speech tagging, and chunking. Wefind that deep learning techniques perform especially well oncross-domain tasks. We have achieved 10% improvement over competitivebaselines on named entity recognition for novel types.
