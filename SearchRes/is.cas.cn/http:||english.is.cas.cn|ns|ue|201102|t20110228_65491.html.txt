 [2-23]Migration of Legacy Applications to Heterogeneous Architectures using HMPP 
Heterogeneous architectures are providing tremendous opportunities to many application fields. Migrating legacy software to accelerator-based architectures (e.g. GPU) is a complex process that requires mastering the technological risks (e.g. loss of code portability, extensive code restructuration, debugging complexity) as well as costs. In this talk, we present a methodology based on HMPP (Heterogeneous Multicore Parallel Programming), allowing incremental processes that reduce the cost and risks of porting codes to heterogeneous hardware. 
Outline of the presentation 1) Introduction 2) GPGPU computing 3) Heterogeneous Multicore Parallel Computing 4) GPGPU Code Tuning 5) Migration Methodology 6) Return of Experiences 7) Conclusion
