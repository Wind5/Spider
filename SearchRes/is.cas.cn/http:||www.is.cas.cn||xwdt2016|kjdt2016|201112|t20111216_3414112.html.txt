As we look beyond the petascale era, accelerators such as Graphics Processing
Units (GPUs) and FPGAs, as well as upcoming integrated hybrid processing cores,
are expected to play a preeminent role in architecting the largest systems in
the world. While there is significant interest in these architectures, much of
this interest is an artifact of the hype associated with them. This workshop
and programming environments of future systems. It seeks to ground accelerator
research through studies of application kernels or whole applications on such
systems, as well as tools and libraries that improve the performance or
The goal of this workshop is to bring together researchers and practitioners
who are involved in application studies for accelerators and other hybrid
systems, to learn the opportunities and challenges in future design trends for
We are soliciting contributions in areas including but not limited to:
 * Techniques for optimizing kernels for execution on GPUs and future
 * Modeling of applications running on accelerators and hybrid HPC systems.
 * Tools and techniques to assist application development for accelerators and
