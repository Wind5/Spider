 报告题目:Integrative Network Analytics for Insights Generation from Massive Healthcare Data 报告人：Dr. Fei Wang  时间：2016年7月27日 9:30  地点：5号楼第二会议室   　　 　　报告摘要:　　    　　    The arrival of the Precision Medicine age brings tremendous opportunities to scientific discovery and quality improvement in medicine and healthcare. However, it also raises big challenges in dealing with large and massive healthcare data from heterogeneous sources. In this talk, I will present a computational framework called integrative network analytics to generate insights from complex healthcare data including Electronic Health Records (EHR), drug development data, genomic data, etc. I will also demonstrate how such framework can be used in computational drug discovery and personalized treatment recommendation. 　　　　　　　　　      　　　　    　　    　　报告人简介:　　     　　    Fei Wang is an Assistant Professor in Division of Health Informatics, Department of Healthcare Policy and Research, Cornell University.
