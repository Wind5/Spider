State Key Laboratory of Computer Science----Institute of Software Chinese Academy of Sciences
 The Laboratory for Computer Science (LCS) was founded in 1993 as a department of Institute of Software, upgraded to a Key Laboratory of Chinese Academy of Sciences in 1994, and further upgraded to a State Key Laboratory in 2007. The goal of research in LCS is to advance the fundamentals in computer science and foundations of software. Since LCS was founded in 1993, the research in LCS consists of four primary areas: Theories and Applications of Concurrent and Real-Time Systems, Principles of Software Technology, Computer Graphics and Human Computer Interaction, and Parallel Algorithm and Parallel Software. The research done in LCS can also be viewed as two parts: Theories and Applications. The theory research includes concurrency, formal approaches to real-time systems, formal specifications, testing, functional programming languages, and computer graphics. Currently the laboratoryâ€™s research is focused on trustworthy software. At the application side, the laboratory also cooperates with other centers of the institute to conduct application-oriented research on topics such as software quality assurance, object-oriented and middleware technology, parallel computing, and human-computer interface technology. Members of the laboratory have received numerous awards, the most prominent being: National Natural Science Awards, one first class (1989), two second class (1987, 1999); National Science and Technology Advancement Awards, four second class (1992, 2000, 2002, 2005). The laboratory was ranked "excellent" in the year 2002 nationwide evaluation of information science key laboratories (conducted every five years).   http://lcs.ios.ac.cn/en/wiki/Main_Page
