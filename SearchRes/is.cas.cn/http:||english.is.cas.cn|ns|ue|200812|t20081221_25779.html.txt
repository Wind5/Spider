Speakerï¼šProfessor Arieh Iserles         Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics         Centre for Mathematical Sciences         University of Cambridge
The main research of Professor Arieh Iserles is on various aspects of 
numerical ordinary differential equations. It spans Geometric integration; Highly oscillatory integrals in one or more dimensions; Acceleration of convergence and its connection with complex dynamics; Approximation by orthogonal linear combinations of exponentials; The theory of orthogonal and biorthogonal polynomials; Orthogonality in multivariate Sobolev spaces; Functional-differential equations with proportional delay; Infinite-dimensional systems of ODEs and their numerical treatment.
