Software Engineering is a field about how to improve the productivity and effectiveness of industrial practices. Since its birth, the debate about whether Software Engineering(SE) should employ more theoretical approaches or more expirical-driven techniques has been going on in the community of software engineering researchers and practitioners. Empirical Software Engineering(ESE), as a subfield of SE, involves the collection and analysis of data and experience that can be used to characterize, evaluate and reveal relationships between software development deliverables, practices, and technologies. Over time, it is expected that such empirical results will form a body of knowledge leading to widely accepted and well-formed theories. In this talk, I will cover the history of software engineering and the concepts in empirical software engineering, introduce the ongoing research trends, and discuss some remaining challenges in this subfield.
Ye Yang received her B.S. degrees in both Computer Science and Economics from Peking University in 1994, and her M.S. in Computer Science from ISCAS in 1998, and her Ph.D. in Computer Science from USC in 2006. 
Between 1999 and 2001, she was part of the SoftPM team at ISCAS. After joining the Center for Systems and Software Engineering at USC in 2001, she had been working on several projects including software cost modeling, process modeling, and risk modeling for COTS-based development Product Line approach adoption. After returning ISCAS in 2007, she has led and participated in several projects funded by Chinese national NSF, 863 plan, and CAS programs. She has served or is serving as PC for ICCBSS, SPW/ICSP, SEAFOOD, and COCOMO Forum. 
Her research interests include software process modeling, software cost modeling, and software measurement and metrics.
