 活动介绍：  报告题目: Learning Effective Representations           with Electronic Health Records 　　　            报告人: 王飞教授时间: 2015年7月10日上午09:30 地点: 软件所5号楼4层第一会议室   摘要:                 Data-Driven Healthcare (DDH) has aroused considerable interests from various research fields in recent years. Patient Electronic Health Records (EHR) is one of the major carriers for conducting DDH research. There are  a lot of challenges on working directly with EHR, such as sparsity, high-dimensionality, and temporality. In this talk I will introduce my recent works on learning effective representations for EHR including: 1) a grouping scheme to get higher level EHR representations 2) temporal pattern extraction to explore the event temporalities of EHR. We will show various applications of those techniques including early prediction of the onset risk of chronic diseases and disease progression modeling.　　 报告人简介:                Fei Wang is currently an associate professor in Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Connecticut.
