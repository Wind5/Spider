 Title: An Introduction to Parametric Search and Its Applications Speaker：Binhai Zhu （朱滨海）　　　　Computer Science Department 　　　　Montana State University 　　　　Bozeman, Mt 59717 　　　　USA Time: 10:00 am, Jan.5, 2009 Venue：Lecture room, State Key Lab of Computer Science, Level 3 Building #5 Abstract: Parametric search is a powerful tool for solving single-parameter geometric optimization problems efficiently (like computing the smallest enclosing ball for a set of points). Invented by Nimrod Megiddo in 1983, it has been widely used in the computational geometry community. In this talk, I will introduce parametric search via a few simple examples. I will also pose some related open problems. Short CV
Dr. Binhai Zhu obtained his PhD from McGill University, Canada in 1994. He did his post-doc at Los Alamos National Laboratory, NM, USA between 1994 and 1996. Since 1996 he has taught in Hong Kong, Canada and USA. He is currently a professor at the Computer Science Department, Montana State University, USA. He has published over 100 papers in international journals and conference proceedings. He was the program committee co-chair for COCOON2003, AAIM2005, and COCOA2007. His current research interests are mainly in geometric computing and computational biology. More information can be found on his web page at http://www.cs.montana.edu/bhz.
