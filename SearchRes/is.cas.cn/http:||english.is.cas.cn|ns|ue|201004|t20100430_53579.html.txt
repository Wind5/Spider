Collaborative Filtering (CF) is a method for personalized recommendation. The sparsity of rating data poses a heavy influence on the quality of CF's recommendation. Meanwhile, there is more and more tag information generated by online users that implies their preferences. Exploiting these tag data is a promising means to alleviate the sparsity problem. Although the intention is straight-forward, there's no existed solution that makes full use of tags to improve the item recommendation quality of traditional rating-based collaborative Filtering approaches. Here we propose a novel approach to fuse a tag-based neighborhood method into the traditional rating-based CF. Tag-based neighborhood method is employed to find similar users and items. This neighborhood information helps the sequent CF procedure produce higher quality recommendations. The experiments show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art ones.
