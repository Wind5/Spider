Abstract: With the ever-growing complexity of modern software, it becomes more and more challenging to validate software behaves as expected. In this talk, instead of delving into technical details, I will give a brief overview of our program analysis and verification tool set for commercial-strength software applications. The talk considers target applications of our techniques from the real world, including web security analysis, malware detection, access control, etc. in language-based security, context-sensitive program analysis, traveling-salesman-like analysis and verification problems, etc. in software validation, and symbolic execution in software testing.ã€€  Bio:Xin Li is Research Assistant Professor of the School of Information Science at JAIST. Her research interests span program analysis, formal verification, language-based security and software engineering. Her current objective is developing methodologies, techniques, and tools, to improve the reliability and security of large-scale commercial-strength software.----Welcome to subscribe to the SKLCS News RSS Service http://lcs.ios.ac.cn/feed/?feed=rss2.
