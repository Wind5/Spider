In this talk, we first introduce models for image processing based on partial differential equations. This part will cover the well-known models related to ROF (total variation model), Mumford-Shah model, Euler's elastica model. Then we will give some details in using these models for image processing, including image restoration, image segmentation, noise removal and image inpainting.
In order to use these models for real industrial applications, fast numerical methods are needed. We start with the traditional gradient decent algorithms. Afterwards, we will go through some modern fast numerical schemes including: Dual algorithms, Alternating minimization algorithms, Augmented Lagrangian methods, graph cuts schemes and some fast iterative algorithms that have been proposed recently.
