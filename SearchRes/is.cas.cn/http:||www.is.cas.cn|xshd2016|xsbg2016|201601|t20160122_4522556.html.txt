 SKLCS Seminar Title: Fully Automated Shape Analysis Based on Forest AutomataSpeaker: Ondrej Lengal (Institute of Information Science, Academia Sinica, Taiwan)Time: 15:00, December 16th (Wednesday), 2015.Venue:  Seminar Room (334), Level 3, Building 5, Institute of Software,              Chinese Academy of Sciences. Abstract:   Forest automata (FAs) have recently been proposed as a tool for shape  analysis of complex heap structures [1]. FAs encode sets of tree  decompositions of heap graphs in the form of tuples of tree automata. In  order to allow representing complex heap graphs, the notion of Fas  allowed one to provide user-defined FAs (called boxes) that encode  repetitive graph patterns of shape graphs to be used as alphabet symbols  of other, higher-level FAs. Later, we proposed a novel technique of  automatically learning the FAs to be used as boxes that avoids the need  of providing them manually [2]. The result was an efficient,  fully-automated analysis that could handle even as complex data  structures as skip lists. In the most recent contribution [3], we  extended the framework with constraints between data elements of nodes  in the heaps represented by FAs, modifying the abstract interpretation  used, to allow us verify programs depending on ordering relations among  data values. We evaluated our approach on programs manipulating  different flavours of lists (singly/doubly linked, circular, nested, ...),  trees, skip lists, and their combinations. The experiments show that our  approach is not only fully automated, rather general, but also quite  efficient.   [1] P. Habermehl, L. Holik, J. Simacek, A. Rogalewicz, and T. Vojnar.
