The correct behavior and reliable operation of a system relies not only on what users can permitted to do, but oftentimes on what users are required to so. Such obligatory actions are integral to the security procedures of many enterprises. The management of obligations in security policies imposes significant challenges since obligations bear quite different properties from traditional access control. For example, obligation fulfillment cannot be enforced. Also, obligations may interfere with future authorization states which must be counted to ensure their consistency.
In this talk, we present the design of a framework to systematically manage user obligations and their interactions with security policies, including obligation modeling, security objectives, and security checking and maintenance. The framework is centered around the concept of accountability, which articulates the dependency between obligation and authorizations. We present the formal definition of accountability and discuss how to ensure accountability as a security objective in a system.
