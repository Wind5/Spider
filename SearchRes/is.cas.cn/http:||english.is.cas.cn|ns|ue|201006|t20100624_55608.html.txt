We investigate the unbalanced cut problems. A cut (A, B) is called unbalanced if the size of its smaller side is at most k (called k-size) or exactly k (called Ek-size), where k is an input parameter. We consider three types of unbalanced cut problems, in which the quality of a cut is measured with respect to the capacity, the sparsity, and the conductance, respectively.
1) We show that even if the input graph is restricted to be a tree, the Ek-Sparsest Cut problem (to find an Ek-size cut with the minimum sparsity) is still NP-hard. 2) We give a bicriteria approximation algorithm for the k-Sparsest Cut problem (to find a k-size cut with the minimum sparsity), which outputs a cut whose sparsity is at most O(\log n) times the optimum and whose smaller side has size at most O(\log n)k. As a consequence, this leads to a (O(\log n), O(\log n))-approximation algorithm for the Min k-Conductance problem (to find a k-size cut with the minimum conductance), which has particular applications in the identification of community structure in social networks.
