 　　SKLCS Seminar 　　  　　Title: Expressiveness of Communication Primitives 　　Speaker: Thomas Given-Wilson (INRIA Saclay, France) 　　                 inria.academia.edu/ThomasGivenWilson 　　  　　Time: 15:00, September 14th (Monday), 2015 　　Venue: Seminar Room (334), Level 3, Building 5, 　　Institute of Software, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), 　　4 Zhongguancun South Fourth Street, Haidian District, 　　Beijing 100190. 　　  　　Abstract: 　　The expressiveness of process calculi is a widely explored area, even when limited to focusing upon their communication primitives. Several recent works have built upon a common framework to relate families of process calculi by common features of their communication primitives. Prior work has considered synchronism (asynchronous vs synchronous), arity (monadic vs polyadic), communication medium (database based vs channel based), and pattern matching (non-matching vs name matching vs intensional). This presentation recalls encodability criteria for relating process calculi and presents the key ideas from recent and ongoing work that extends to new features. In particular results for coordination (binary vs joining vs others) such as in the join calculus and broadcast calculi, and symmetry (asymmetric vs symmetric) such as in fusion calculus and concurrent pattern calculus. 　　  　　Bio: 　　Thomas Given-Wilson is a Post-Doctoral Researcher at Inria (French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation). He is interested in foundations of computation and concurrency, privacy and security, and quantified information flow. More specifically, his work examines the relations between different models of computation and communication as a foundation for programming languages and interaction; quantification of security systems and cryptography; and compositional approaches to quantified information leakage.
