Abstract： We develop a version of the picalculus where channels are interpreted as resources which have costs associated with them. Code runs under the financial responsibility of owners; they must pay to use resources, but may profit by providing them. 
We provide a behavioural theory based on bisimulations and demonstrate its usefulness via a series of examples. We also justify the theory via a contextual characterisation.
