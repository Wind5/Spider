 　　SKLCS Seminar   　　Title: On Coinduction and Quantum Lambda Calculi  　　Speaker：Yuxin Deng (East China Normal University, China)  　　         basics.sjtu.edu.cn/~yuxin 　　  　　Time: 12th August 2015, 14:00 　　Venue: Seminar Room (334), Level 3, Building 5, Institute of Software, CAS　　　　　　Abstract:  　　In the ubiquitous presence of linear resources in quantum computation, program equivalence in linear contexts, where programs are used or executed once, is more important than in the classical setting. We introduce a linear contextual equivalence and two notions of bisimilarity, a state-based and a distribution-based, as proof techniques for reasoning about higher-order quantum programs. Both notions of bisimilarity are sound with respect to the linear contextual equivalence, but only the distribution-based one turns out to be complete. The completeness proof relies on a characterisation of the bisimilarity as a testing equivalence. 　　(Joint work with Yuan Feng and Ugo Dal Lago)
