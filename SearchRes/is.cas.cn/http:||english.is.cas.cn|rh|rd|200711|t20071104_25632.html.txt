 The Intelligence Engineering Lab was founded on January 11, 1999. It is committed to conduct the innovative technology research and development in Human-Computer Interaction.
Since its inception, the lab has finished nearly 20 state-level key projects, and won a second prize of the State Scientific and Technological Progress Award. We have published more than 200 papers in journals and conference proceedings, some of which were published in top international academic conferences, such as ACM CHI, ACM IUI, IEEE RTSS, etc. Moreover, we have developed a distributed real-time database system Agilor, which has been found wide applications in manufacturing and everyday life. 
The lab has established strong collaborative relationships with many foreign academic institutes, such as UC Berkeley, CMU, UVA, University of Cambridge, IFIP TC13, France Telecom, Kochi University and so on. So far, there are 23 faculty members in the lab, including 8 research fellows, 10 associate research fellows. The research team is young and energetic. Besides, there are 52 doctorate students and graduate students, including a foreign student.
It is our goal to be an internationally renowned laboratory with a first-class environment, first-class talents, and top-notch achievements.
