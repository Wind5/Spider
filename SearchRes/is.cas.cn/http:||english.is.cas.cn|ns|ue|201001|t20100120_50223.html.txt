Title：Turing Definability -- current trends in computabilitySpeaker：Angsheng Li（李昂生）Time：16:30 – 17:30, Jan. 20, 2010Venue：Lecture Room, State Key Lab of Computer Science, Level 3 Building #5
Abstract：We review the recent progress in computability, including the solution of the major sub-degree problem of Lachlan in 1967, and new results and problems following up the major sub-degree theorem.
Biography：Angsheng Li received his ph D in the Institute of Software, Chinese Academy of Sciences in 1993. After ph D, he has been working in the Institute, and appointed as associate professor and full professor in 1996, and 1999 respectively. Angsheng Li works in computability theory, especially in mathematical structures of Turing computations. He received the 2003 NSFC Distinguished Young Investigator award, and the 2008 Hundred-Talent Program award of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.He has published more than 20 papers in internationally leading journals such as Proceedings of the London Mathematical Society, Journal of the London Mathematical Society, Transactions of the American Mathematical Society, Mathematical Structures in Computer Science, Theoretical Computer Science, Annals of Pure and applied Logic, Journal of Symbolic Logic, Archive for Mathematical Logic, Illinois Journal of Mathematics, and Israel Journal of Mathematics etc. He is currently a Steering Committee member of the international conference series Theory and Applications of Models of Computation, and is co-chair of TAMC 2010 to be held in Prague, the capital of the Czech Republic, in May 2010.His current research interests include local algorithms in network, mathematical property test, game theoretical and local approaches to computation, and combinatorial principles of Turing computations.
