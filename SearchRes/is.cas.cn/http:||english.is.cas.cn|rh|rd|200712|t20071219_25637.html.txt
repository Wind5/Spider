 In broadband multimedia access network, we develop high performance switch, application servers and multimedia gateways, the corresponding application software, network management and protocol software, and integrate them as a set of broadband network system that can simultaneously provide multi-services including IP telephone, digital TV, Video on Demand, video conference and Internet access, so that the computer network, TV network, and telephone network converges to a single network. In wireless and mobile communication, our researches include sensor network.and data communication on smartphone
