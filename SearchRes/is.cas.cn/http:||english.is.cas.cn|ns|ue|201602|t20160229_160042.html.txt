 [11-10]Hybrid Vortex Model for Efficient Diffusive, Turbulent Smoke Simulations 
 Title: Hybrid Vortex Model for Efficient Diffusive, Turbulent Smoke SimulationsSpeaker: Prof. Hanqiu Sun            VR, Visualization & Imaging Research Centre            Dept. of Computer Science & Engineering            The Chinese University of Hong KongTime：2:30-4:00pm, Nov. 17th, 2015Venue：Seminar Room (334), Level 3, Building 5, Institute of Software, Chinese Academy of Sciences Abstract Vortex based simulation methods can produce attractive visual effects, so mostfavored to enhance the dynamic smoke simulation. However, using such physical models isstill a challenging task to efficiently and stably reproduce high-quality smoke, as the motion isinfluenced by all other vortex elements in the simulation domain in which vortex stretchingand the complex evolution are hard to tackle. In this work, we present the novel hybrid vortexmodel that seamlessly fuses the vortex filament and vortex particle in one system toefficiently simulate stable and scalable dynamic smokes. We first introduce the vortexfilaments in grids scheme, in which the grids dynamically bridge the motion of vortexfilaments and smoke particles for efficient smoke simulation with fine visual effects. Wefurther work on converting the vortex filament when overly stretched into vortex particleswhile maintaining the total circulation, which effectively stabilizes the simulator. We alsorealize the parallel processing of hybrid vortex model on the modern GPU, so furtherimproving the simulation efficiency. The experimental results demonstrated that our hybridscheme enables producing the visual plausibility with diffusive and highly turbulent smokeeffects, as well as the flexibility for scale of details and efficient simulation performance.
