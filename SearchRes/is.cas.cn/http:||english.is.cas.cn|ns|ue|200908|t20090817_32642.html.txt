 [7-23]Moduli of Smoothness and K-functionals on Unit Sphere and Unit Ball 
 Title：Moduli of Smoothness and K-functionals on Unit Sphere and Unit BallSpeaker：Prof. Yuan Xu (徐源), Department of Mathematics, University of Oregon
Abstract：A new modulus of smoothness based on the Euler angles is introduced on the unit sphere and is shown to satisfy all the usual characteristic properties of moduli of smoothness, including direct and inverse theorem for the best approximation by polynomials and its equivalence to a K-functional, de ned via partial derivatives in Euler angles. It also leads to new moduli of smoothness and K-functionals on the unit ball, which are used to study approximation by polynomials on the ball.
