 Title：DDMs for PDEs: the history and recent developmentsSpeaker：Maksymilian DryjaTime：9:30-10:10 am, Thursday, August 13Venue：Room 334, Level 3 Building #5 
The first part of the talk will be devoted to a short history of Domain Decomposition Methods (DDMs) for solving PDEs. In particular a development of additive Schwarz methods: ideas, classifications and theories. In the second part of the talk modern discretizations of PDEs, based on domain decomposition approach, will be presented. The mortar method and discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method will be discussed for discretizations of elliptic problems. The analysis of convergence will be presented. Challenges problems are designing, analysis and implementation of optimal DDMs for the obtained discrete problems. These questions will be briefly discussed.
Biography：Maksymilian Dryja received his PhD from Moscow University in 1973. He is interested in numerical solution of PDEs, in particular in designing and analysis of parallel algorithms for solving discrete problems for PDEs. He is a professor in the Department of Mathematics, Informatics and Mechanics, Warsaw University.
