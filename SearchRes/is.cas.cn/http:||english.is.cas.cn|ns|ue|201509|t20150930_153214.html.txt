 SKLCS Seminar Title: Formal Verification of Simulink/Stateflow Diagrams Speaker: Shuling Wang (Institute of Software, CAS) Time: 15:00, 29th September 2015 Venue:  Seminar Room (334), Level 3, Building 5, Institute of Software,              Chinese Academy of Sciences. Abstract. Simulink is an industrial de-facto standard for building executablemodels of control systems and their environments. Stateflow is atoolbox used to model reactive systems via hierarchical statechartswithin a Simulink model, extending Simulink's scope to event-drivenand hybrid forms of embedded control.  In safety-critical controlsystems, exhaustive coverage of system dynamics by formalverification would be desirable, being based on a formal semanticsof combined Simulink/Stateflow graphical models. In our previous work, we addressed the problem of formal verification of pureSimulink diagrams via an encoding into HCSP, a formal modellinglanguage encoding hybrid system dynamics by means of an extension ofCSP. In this talk, we present our recent work that extends the approach tocover Simulink models containing Stateflow components also. The transformationfrom Simulink/Stateflow to HCSP is fully automatic, and the formalverification of the encoding is supported by a Hybrid Hoare Logic(HHL) prover based on Isabelle/HOL. We demonstrate our approach bya real world case study originating from the Chinese High-speedTrain Control System (CTCS-3). This is a joint work with Naijun Zhan, Liang Zou, and Martin Fraenzle.  Biography: Dr. Shuling Wang is currently an assistant professor of the State Key Lab.of Computer Science, Institute of Software, Chinese Academy of Sciences.Before that, she received her Ph.D. degree from Peking University in 2008,and she was a postdoc of UNU-IIST and ISCAS from 2008 to 2010 and from2010 to 2012 respectively.
