 The Institute of Software, Chinese Academy of Sciences (ISCAS) is a research base that focuses on the research and development on scientific theories of computer and leading edge technologies of sofeware. ISCAS was founded on March 1st,1985.It is situated at No.4,Zhongguancun South 4th Street,Haidian District,in Beijing. Initially,there were only five founder members.They did research by two 16-bit microcomputers in the rooms that they borrowed with a small amount of funding per year.But being "Innovative, Pragmatic and Competitive",ISCAS has been making unceasing progress in past decades.Nowadays,ISCAS possesses three building.It raises more than two hundred million RMB per year in research funding.With all staffs endeavor,ISCAS is going to develop faster and stronger.   ISCAS has already esablished three scientific research systems.They are basic reseach system in leading-edge areas,which is led by several state key laboratories and national engineering research centers,high technology research system and application research system.ISCAS focuses its research fields and related research ares on computer science,computer software of Basic Research Department,Hi-Tech Research Department,Application Research Department as well as General Department.It owns a group of celebrated scientists and a team of young talents with strong research capabilities.   There are 646 employees in ISCAS as of November,2013.Among them,there are 3 academicians of Chinese Academy of Science,1 academician of the Third World Academy of Science,58 research professors,102 associate research professors and senior engineers,3 awardees of National Founds for Distinguished Young Scientists,and 8 persons selected by Hundred Talent Program.The average age of the employees is only 36.   ISCAS has had authority to grant PhD and Master's degrees in two primary disciplines:Comper Science & Technology,and Software Engineering.It cultivates full-time graduate students majored in Computer Technology and Software Engineering.ISCAS is one of the pilot institutes of engineering doctoral education in Electronic and Information.Now,two post-doctoral stations in Computer Science & Technology and Software Engineering have been set up.There are 262 graduate students,193 PhD candidates and 16 post-doctoral research fellows in ISCAS.   Meanwhile,ISCAS has built up close relationships with more than forty countries on academic exchange and technology cooperation.It also cooperates with domestic provinces and cities in China.Nowadays,five branches have been set up in Wuxi,Chongqing,Harbin,Guangzhou,Qingdao and Guiyang. In addition,Chinese Infomation Processing Society of China(CIPS),Mathematical Sofeware Branch of China Software Industry Association(CSIA),and Cryptographic Algorithms Commission of Chinese Association for Cryptologic Research(CACR)are all affiliated to ISCAS also sponsors academic joumals,including Joumal of Software,Joumal of Chinese Infomation Processing,Computer Systems & Applications,and Intemational Joumal of Software and Onformatics.   Fruitful results have been achieved on computer sciences and software technologies in the last nearly thirty years by ISCAS.Thirty-four Achievement Awards at the academy,ministerial and state level are obtainde(ISCAS is the first conteibutor o the Award).The awards ISCAS has won range from State Natural Sciences Awards(1 first prize,2second prizes and 1 third prize)to State Science and Technology Progress Award(8 second prizes,2 third prizes).It's worth mentioning that since the State Natural Sciences Award was issued,the only 1 first prize zward in computer field was given to ISCAS.
