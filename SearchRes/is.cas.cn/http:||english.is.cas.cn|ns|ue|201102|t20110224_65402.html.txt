Title：Seeking practical scientific creativity in Human Computer Interaction: recent research projects in the NUS HCI research lab.
Location：Lecture room, Lab for Computer Science, Level 3 Building #5, Institute of Software, CAS
This talk will introduce several recent projects from the NUS HCI research lab from the computer science department, National University of Singapore, including SandCanvas and Farmer's Tale. In SandCanvas, we have developed a new multi-touch digital artistic medium that simplifies the creation of sand animations, which is a performance art technique in which an artist tells stories by creating animated images with sand. In Farmer's tale, we have created a Facebook game modeled after the famous game "FarmVille" to attract and make it easier for people to volunteer. In addition, a few other projects as well as lessons in starting and managing a new research lab will also be briefly discussed.
