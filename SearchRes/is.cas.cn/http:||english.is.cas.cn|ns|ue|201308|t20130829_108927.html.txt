 Title: Mu and mu tilde:  two useful combinators Speaker: Pierre-Louis Curien (CNRS and Univ. Paris Diderot) Time: 10:30, August 30th, 2013 Venue: Lecture Room, 3rd Floor, Building #5, State Key Laboratory of Computer Science, Institute of Software, Chinese Academy of Sciences Abstract: In my work with Hugo Herbelin, and then with my student Guillaume Munch, we explored term syntaxes for sequent calculus (for classical logic) I recently found that the same style of syntax allows for a neat description of the wiring structures underlying operads, cooperadsâ€¦, which are used  in contemporary algebra to describe various types of algebras and coalgebras. Under this new light, the fundamental non-determinism of classical logic appears to match the notion of duplicial algebra, proposed by the late mathematician Jean-Louis Loday among a wealth of new algebraic structures which he unveiled over the last 20 years or so.
