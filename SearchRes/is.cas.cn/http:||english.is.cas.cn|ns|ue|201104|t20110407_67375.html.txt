Time: 9:30am, Apr. 11 (Monday), 2011Place: Lecture Room, Level 3, Building No. 5, State Key Laboratory of Computer Science, ISCAS
The use and appearance of IT technology is under rapid and fundamental change. Whereas the primary focus previously was on the computer and its use for computing the technology now manifests itself pervasively, indirectly and invisibly, for example in context-aware applications. Many of the fundamental research challenges in IT, for example, in software engineering remains, however, new ones also emerge as a consequence of the new appearance of IT. The talk will present examples of research at the IT University to interaction. The IT University is the youngest university in Denmark devoted entirely to the digital world.
