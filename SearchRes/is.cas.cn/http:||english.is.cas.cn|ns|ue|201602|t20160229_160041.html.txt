 　　SKLCS Seminar 　　Title:  The Automated-Reasoning Revolution: From Theory to Practice and Back　　Speaker: Moshe Vardi (Rice University, USA)   　　Time: 09:00, March 2nd, 2016　　Venue:  Seminar Room (334), Level 3, Building 5, Institute of Software, Chinese Academy of Sciences.　　　　Abstract:For the past 40 years computer scientists generally believed that 
been considered to be intractable. Over the past 20 years, however, there
has been a quiet, but dramatic, revolution, and very large SAT instances 
are now being solved routinely as part of software and hardware design.
In this talk I will review this amazing development and show how automated 
I will then show describe how we can leverage SAT solving to accomplish 
truth assignments of a given Boolean formula or sampling such assignments 
learning, personalized learning, and more. While the theory of these 
algorithms developed by theoreticians do not scale up to industrial-sized 
but give up certain correctness guarantees to achieve scalability. We 
describe a novel approach, based on universal hashing and Satisfiability 
Modulo Theory, that scales to formulas with hundreds of thousands of 
The talk is accesible to a general CS audience. Biography:Moshe Y. Vardi is the George Distinguished Service Professor in
