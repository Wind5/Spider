Title：Formal Model Driven DesignSpeaker：Dr. Liu Zhiming             The United Nations Unviersity,             International Institute for Software and TechnologyTime：2:30pm, March 28, 2008（Friday）Venue: Lecture room, Lab. of Computer Science, ISCAS
Abstract：We discuss how model driven design can help in improving  dependability of complex software systems. Through its application to the benchmark CoCoME, we show how rCOS, a notation for Refinement of Component and Object System, is used to formalise the key engineering concepts and artifacts  in model driven design. We discuss the problems and experience that we have learnt in this application. 
Bio：Zhiming Liu received his Msc from Institute of Software of Chinese Academy of Science in 1987, PhD from the University of Warwick (UK) in 1991. He worked as a research fellow at the University of Warwick during 1988-1994, a lecturer in Computer Science at the University of Leicester (UK) during 1994-2005. He joined UNU-IIST as a research fellow in Junly 2002.
Zhiming Lius research includes formal methdods and theories of computer systems development, in particular in the areas of Real-Time, Fault-Tolerant Systems, Object Systems and Component Systems.  He is  leading a research team on the rCOS Method for Component-Based and Model Driven Development, with academic members, postdoctoral project fellows, PhD students and fellows.
