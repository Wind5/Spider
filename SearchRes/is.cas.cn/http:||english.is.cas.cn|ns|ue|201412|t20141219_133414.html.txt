 Title: Cloud Computing, Big Data and Scalable Privacy PreservationSpeaker: Jinjun Chen (University of Technology Sydney, Australia)Time: 17th December 2014, 9:30-11:30Venue: Seminar Room (334), Level 3, Building 5, Institute of Software, CASAbstract:Cloud computing promises an open environment where customers can deploy IT services in pay-as-you-go fashion while saving huge capital investment in their own IT infrastructure. While cloud provides a promising infrastructure for big data applications such as medical data analysis, privacy reservation becomes critical because user privacy is a serious concern in practice. In this talk, we will discuss privacy preservation in general and then propose our solutions for scalable privacy preservation of big data applications on cloud.Biography:Dr Jinjun Chen is an Associate Professor from Faculty of Engineering and IT, University of Technology Sydney (UTS), Australia. He is the Director of Lab for Cloud Computing and Distributed Systems, and Lab for Agile Information Systems at UTS. He holds a PhD in Computer Science and Software Engineering from Swinburne University of Technology, Australia. Dr Chen’s research interests include cloud computing, big data, distributed systems, workflow management, privacy and security, and related various research topics. His research results have been published in more than 130 papers in international journals and conferences, including IEEE Transactions on Service Computing, ACM Transactions on Autonomous and Adaptive Systems, ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology (TOSEM), IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering (TSE), IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems (TPDS), and IEEE Transactions on Computers (TC).He received Swinburne Vice-Chancellor’s Research Award for early career researchers (2008), IEEE Computer Society Outstanding Leadership Award (2008-2009) and (2010-2011), IEEE Computer Society Service Award (2007), Swinburne Faculty of ICT Research Thesis Excellence Award (2007). He is an Associate Editor for IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems, IEEE Transactions on Computers, and IEEE Transactions on Cloud Computing.
