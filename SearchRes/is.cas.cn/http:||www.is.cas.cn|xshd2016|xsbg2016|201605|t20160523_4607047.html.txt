 　　SKLCS Seminar 　　  　　Title: Agile Formal Engineering Methods for Software Productivity  and Reliability 　　 　　Speaker:  Shaoying Liu (Hosei University, Japan) 　　  　　Time: 14:30, March 15, 2016 　　 　　Venue:  Seminar Room (334), Level 3, Building 5, Institute of Software, 　　        Chinese Academy of Sciences. 　　  　　Abstract: 　　  　　High software productivity and reliability are two mutually affected goals of software engineering, but how to achieve them in realistic software development projects still remains a challenge. This talk will first overview the existing methods and approaches for software development and then present a new approach for improvement that properly integrates the agile principles into the SOFL formal engineering method. In particular, several specific techniques involved in the Agile-SOFL approach, such as specification animation, specification-based inspection and testing, and incremental specification-based coding in a small cycle, will be explained and discussed. Finally, several important research directions will be introduced for future work. 　　  　　Biography: 　　  　　Shaoying Liu is professor in the Department of Computer Science at Hosei University, Tokyo, Japan. He received the Ph.D in Computer Science from the University of Manchester, UK in 1992. His research interests include formal methods, formal engineering methods, software inspection, automatic testing, and intelligent software engineering environment. He has published over 150 refereed papers in the area of software engineering and formal methods, authored a book entitled “Formal Engineering for Industrial Software Development”, and edited 8 conference proceedings. He has severed as General Chair, PC Chair, and PC members for many international conferences and is on the editorial board of Software Testing, Verification and Reliability (SVTR). He is a fellow of British Computer Society, senior member of IEEE Computer Society, and member of Japan Society for Software Science and Technology.
