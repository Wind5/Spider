Symbolic execution is emerging as a powerful technique for generating test inputs systematically to achieve exhaustive path coverage of a bounded depth. However, its practical use is often limited by path explosion because the number of paths of a program can be exponential in the number of branch conditions encountered during the execution. To mitigate the path explosion problem, we propose a new redundancy removal method to identify sub paths shared by multiple runs and eliminate them during test generation. Pruning away such redundant paths can lead to a potentially exponential reduction in the number of paths. Our experimental results confirm that redundancy due to common sub paths is both abundant and widespread in real-world applications. In both KLEE and Cloud9, the addition of our new method has led to a speedup of up to two orders of magnitude in the execution time.
