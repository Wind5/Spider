Abstractï¼šWe extend the classic testing semantics of De Nicola & Hennessy to a general scenario for probabilistic processes, giving rise to two theories: probabilistic may testing and probabilistic must testing. We provide modal- and relational characterisations of may and must-testing preorders for recursive processes with divergence, featuring probabilistic as well as nondeterministic choice. In finite-state and finitely branching probabilistic processes, may testing can be characterised in terms of simulation, and must testing in terms of failure simulation. 
To this end we develop weak transitions between probabilistic processes, elaborate their topological properties, and capture divergence in terms of partial distributions.
