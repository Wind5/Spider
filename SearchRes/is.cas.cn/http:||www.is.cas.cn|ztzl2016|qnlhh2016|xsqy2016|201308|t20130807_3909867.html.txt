 活动介绍：题目:Decision Making with Assumption-based Argumentation: A Medical Case Study主讲人:Xiuyi Fan 博士时间：2013年8月8日上午9:30-11:00地点：软件所5号楼4层中会议室 内容介绍：In this talk, I will present two formal frameworks for decision making. In both frameworks, decisions have multiple attributes and meet (presumably different) goals. I also study a family of decision functions for making decisions with different criteria, including decisions meeting all goals, most goals, goals no other decisions meet, and most preferred goals. For each decision function, an argumentation-based computational mechanism is defined for computing and explaining the selected decisions. The connection between decision making and argumentation semantics is drawn, i.e., selected decisions in a decision making framework are admissible arguments in the corresponding argumentation framework. The main advantage of this approach is that it not only selects decisions but also gives an argumentation-based justification of selected decisions. I will present a case study using medical literature selection to show the applicability of this approach.主讲人介绍：Xiuyi Fan, 博士，毕业于帝国理工学院（Imperial College London），并留校任职。之前在美国犹他大学（The University of Utah）获取本科和硕士学位。主要研究方向是：Computational Logic and Argumentation、Multi-Agent System and Simulation。研究成果主要发表在人工智能领域顶级会议IJCAI、ECAI、AAMAS、ICRA等。活动宣传：英国帝国理工学院樊修逸博士访问软件所
