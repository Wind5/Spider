 [9-14]Advanced Features of Duration Calculus and Their Applications in Sequential Hybrid Programs 
Title:Advanced Features of Duration Calculus and Their Applications in Sequential Hybrid Programs
Venue:Lecture room, Lab for Computer Science, Level 3 Building #5, 
Abstract: Duration Calculus was introduced as a logic to specify real-time requirements of computing systems. It has been used successfully in a number of case studies. Moreover, many variants were proposed to deal with various features of real time systems, including sequential communicating processes, sequential hybrid systems and imperative programming languages. This talk aims to present work that integrates several variants of Duration Calculus, and provides a semantic framework for real-time programming languages, as well as refinement and verification of sequential hybrid programs.
