      总体部暨基础软件工程研究中心举办学术报告讲座活动，邀请了纽约市立大学教授纪平和英特尔实验室的安全研究员/架构师李晓宁来做报告，报告的题目分别是《Distinguishing MobileDevices Through General WiFi Monitoring》和《New Intel SSDCapabilities and Disk Forensics》，请各位同事积极参加！　　时间：8月18日（周四）下午3点至5点　　地点：5号楼4层第四会议室 　　纪平教授：　　简介：博士毕业于美国麻省州立大学阿默斯特分校，本科毕业于中国清华大学。现任美国纽约市立大学研究生院计算机系教授、副系主任、博士生导师和美国纽约市立大学约翰金分校数学与计算机系教授。从事各种形式的计算机网络研究，包括有线、无线及移动网络的协议设计、分析，网络通信数据、流量分析，网络安全及侦探学，网络数据采集、整合及分析。　　演讲题目：Distinguishing MobileDevices Through General WiFi Monitoring　　演讲摘要：Booming wireless technology makes personal mobile devices (i.e.,smartphone, tablet, etc) must-have gadgets in people’s lives. Along withthe broad deployment of WiFi channels, mobile devices can access the Internetnot only through cell phone networks, but more and more frequently through WiFi(802.11x) channels. As it is easier and legitimate in many circumstancesto monitor the network traffic in WiFi networks, an interesting question toanswer is whether Network Forensics practitioners can distinguish mobiledevices through general WiFi monitoring? In this work, we conduct our researchbased on a set of WiFi traces that covers months of network data in aschool environment and days of data from three busy locations onManhattan. Our goal is to find out that through general WiFi trafficmonitoring, how likely a mobile device can be distinguished from others. Thistalk introduces other related state-of-art research in this area as well.　　李晓宁：英特尔实验室安全研究员/架构师　　简介：Xiaoning Li is asecurity researcher and architect at Intel Labs and focuses onanalyzing/detecting/preventing 0 day/malware with existing/new processorfeatures. For the past 10+ years, his work has been focusing on bothhardware/software security system co-design and advanced threat research.Xiaoning holds 16 grant/filling patents in security areas includingprocessor/system security and has published more than 20+ conference/invitedtalks including BlackHat, CanSecWest, ShmooCon, Source etc.　　演讲题目：New Intel SSDCapabilities and Disk Forensics　　演讲摘要：To investigatecompromised hard drive, traditional disk forensics tools have to scan harddrive to address tampered data details if hard drive does not provide enoughmeta data. Whole disk scanning takes a lot of efforts to analyze disk. Tospeedup this tamper detection process and assist disk forensics usage, newlogging capability is proposed to provide additional information such as diskchange record meta data for software to leverage. This talk will present newIntel SSD capabilities and explain how they could impact on forensics andsecurity usages.
