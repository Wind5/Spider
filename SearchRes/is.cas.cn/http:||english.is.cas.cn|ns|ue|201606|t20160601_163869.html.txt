 　　SKLCS Seminar 　　　　Title: Why Is Software Architecture Important?　　Speaker: Roger Lee (Central Michigan University, USA)    www.seiti.cmich.edu        　　Time:  15:00, Monday, June 6th, 2016　　Venue:  Seminar Room (334), Level 3, Building 5, Institute of Software, Chinese Academy of Sciences.　　　　Abstract:　　Software Architecture is an important field of study that is becoming more important and more talked about with every passing day.  Nevertheless, to our knowledge, there exist little practical guidelines on managing software architecture in a real software development organization, from both technical and managerial perspectives.　　In this talk, we will talk about what software architecture is, where software architecture fits in the development life cycle of software engineering, views to software architecture, requirements that are most important to architectural design, achieving quality attribute requirements, other influences on the architecture, and why software architecture is important.　　Brief Bio:　　Dr. Roger Lee is Director of Software Engineering & Information Technology Institute and Professor of Computer Science at Central Michigan University, Mount Pleasant, Michigan, U.S.A.  He received his Ph.Ds. from University of Southern Mississippi in USA and Shizuoka University in Japan, respectively.　　Dr. Lee's contributions to the field include the establishment of the International Association for Computer and Information Science (ACIS) in 1999 and the International Journal of Computer and Information Science (IJCIS) in 2000, International Journal of Networked and Distributed Computing (IJNDC) and International Journal of Software Innovation (IJSI) in 2012.  　　He is currently serving as CEO & Chairman of the International Association for Computer & Information Science (ACIS) and Editor-in-Chief of International Journal　of Software Innovation (IJSI) and the Managing Editor of International Journal of Networked and Distributed Computing (IJNDC) & International Journal of Computer and Information Science (IJCIS).　　He is a member of ACIS and IEEE.
