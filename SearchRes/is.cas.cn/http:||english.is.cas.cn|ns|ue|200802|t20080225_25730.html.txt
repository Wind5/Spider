 Title: Verifiers are ProgramsSpeaker: Dr. Chen Yifeng             Dept. of Computer Science, University of Durham, UKTime: 3:30pm, Tuesday Feb. 26, 2008Venue: Lecture room, Lab. of Computer Science, ISCAS
This talk will report our recent results on the relation between execution and verification. A simple imperative language with execution and verification commands is introduced. A machine only executes execution commands of a program, while the compiler only performs the verification commands. Common commands in other languages can be defined as a combination of execution and verification commands. Design of verifiers then becomes program design using  verification commands. It is shown  that type checking, abstract interpretation, modeling checking and Hoare Logic are all special verification programs, so are many of their combinations.
