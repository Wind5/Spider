  SKLCS Seminar Title: Multivariable Algorithmics Speaker: Rod Downey (Victoria Univ. of Wellington, New Zealand)                 homepages.ecs.vuw.ac.nz/~downey Time:  15:00, April 26th, 2016 Venue:  Seminar Room (334), Level 3, Building 5, Institute of Software,        Chinese Academy of Sciences. Abstract: Multivariable algorithmics seeks to develop algorithms andcomplexity theory in a theory taking account of the parametersassociated with the input data. This area has seen enormous progressin the last 25 years. I will look at the development, achievements,and challenges associated with the area in a general talk. Biography: Rod Downey works in the theory of computation, computationalcomplexity and most recently, algorithmic randomness. The last seeksto reconcile statistical notions with those of algorithmic informationtheory. The former seeks to try to develop complexity theory to beattuned to real computation by exploiting the multivariant nature ofdata. He has won numerous awards for his work in logic and his work intheoretical computer science. These include the inaugural MacLaurinFellowship, the Hamilton Prize of the Royal Society of NZ, and the ASLShoenfield Prize in Logic. He has been an organizer for severalDagstuhl meetings, including ones on parameterized complexity (whichhe co-invented with Mike Fellows) and one on computation on infinitestructures. He was the first New Zealand based mathematician to givean invited lecture at the International Congress of Mathematicians, inits 100+ year history, and is only the second New Zealand basedcomputer scientist to become a Fellow of Association for ComputingMachinery. He has given invited addresses an numerous conferencesincluding the International Congress of Logic Methodology andPhilosophy of Science, and the IEEE Conference on ComputationalComplexity, is an editor of several journals, and author of around 200journal papers, and several books.
