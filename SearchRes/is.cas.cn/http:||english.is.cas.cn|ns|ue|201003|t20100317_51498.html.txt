With the wide available of sensors, microphones, cameras in the environment and in mobile devices, there are many opportunities for intelligent interfaces. Intelligent interfaces offer efficient and natural communication (e.g using natural language). I will describe three projects from our lab.  Illuminac is a speech input system and learning interface that creates intuitive patterns of light in response to speech commands. In a second project, we used accelerometers attached to free weights to track the form of people doing weight exercise in the gym. Finally, I'll describe our ongoing work on monitoring mental health using voice signals. This project uses either cell phones or microphones embedded in the environment to monitor speech, and recognize cues to changes in mood or specific mental problems like sleep loss or depression.
John Canny is the Paul and Stacy Jacobs Distinguished Professor of Engineering in the Computer Science Division at UC Berkeley. His early research was in computer vision and robotics - on the interaction between computers and the physical world.  Since the 1990's he has focused on the democratization of computing, and what it means to design systems for everyday life. In 2002, he founded the Berkeley Institute of Design, an interdisciplinary, human-centered design research lab. BID now houses 30 researchers from 8 departments. His research priorities are IT for health care and education, ICT4D, models of human behavior and ubiquitous computing. His Ph.D. thesis won the ACM doctoral dissertation award, and a paper based on his M.S. thesis received the AAAI test of time award a decade later. He has recent best paper prizes at CHI 2007, Persuasive Technology 2008 and ACM KDD 2009.
