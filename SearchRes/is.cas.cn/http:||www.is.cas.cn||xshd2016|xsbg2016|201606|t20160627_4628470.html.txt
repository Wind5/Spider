 　　报告题目： Computational Approaches for Medical and Health Care Problems 　　主讲人： Danny Ziyi Chen 　　报告时间：6月30日（周四） 14:00 --- 16:00 　　报告地点：五号楼三层334 　　                                                                  　　Abstract 　　Computer technology plays a vital role in modern medicine, health care, and life sciences, especially in medical imaging, human genome study, clinical diagnosis and prognosis, treatment planning and optimization, and medical data management and analysis.  As computer technology continues to evolve, computer science research and development will inevitably become an integral part of modern medicine and health care.  Computational research and applications on modeling, formulating, and solving core problems in medicine and health care are not only crucially needed, but are actually indispensable.   　　In this talk, we present a set of important computational problems and approaches in modern medical research, clinical practice, and applications, with a focus on medical imaging. In particular, we discuss computational problems that arise in medical imaging, clinical diagnosis, and other medical applications.  These include identification and distribution analysis of immune cells (for the diagnosis and prognosis of breast cancer, inflammation diseases, and auto-immune diseases, and in stem cell study of leukemia bone marrow micro-environments), optimal segmentation and analysis of many medical objects in 3D images (e.g., blood clots, joint structures, retinal layers, airway and vascular networks, etc), motion tracking of massive swarming bacteria in image movies, etc.  We demonstrate new models for formulating such problems as computational problems, and provide effective approaches for solving them.  Our approaches are based on machine learning (deep learning), data mining, and geometric techniques.  Further, we show experimental data and results to illustrate the clinical applications of our approaches.  Finally, we highlight some important future research trends and problems in the exciting emerging area of computational medicine and health care. 　　Biography 　　Dr. Danny Ziyi Chen received the B.S. degrees in Computer Science and in Mathematics from the University of San Francisco, California, USA in 1985, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in Computer Science from Purdue University, West Lafayette, Indiana, USA in 1988 and 1992, respectively.
