 (The talk will be focused on the Moving Object Models and also the implementation of them on the SECONDO extensible DBMS). Speaker：Prof. Ralf Hartmut Gting  (University of Hagen, Germany) 
Time：9:30 - 11:00 am, May 22Venue：Lecture room, State Key Lab of Computer Science, Level 3 Building #5 
Ralf Hartmut Gting has been a full professor in Computer Science at the University of Hagen, Germany, since 1989. He received his Diploma and Dr. rer. nat. degrees from the University of Dortmund in 1980 and 1983, respectively, and became a professor at that university in 1987. From 1981 until 1984 his main research area was Computational Geometry. After a one-year stay at the IBM Almaden Research Center in 1985, extensible and spatial database systems became his major research interests; more recently, also spatio-temporal or moving objects databases. He has been an associate editor of the ACM Transactions on Database Systems and an editor of GeoInformatica, VLDB Journal, and SIGMOD Anthonogy. He has published two German text books on data structures and algorithms and on compilers, respectively, and an English text book on moving objects databases. His is the author of the most cited paper of ACM TODS "A Foundation for Representing and Querying Moving Objects", and the second most cited paper of the VLDB Journal "An Introduction to Spatial Database Systems", in the period 1994 through 2003. His group has built prototypes of extensible and spatio-temporal database systems, the Gral system and the SECONDO system.
