Software is hard to be bug-free, while removing the software faults can be time-consuming. To automate the software debugging process, fault localization is proposed. Existing fault localization techniques assess the suspiciousness of each individual program statements to be related to fault and are empirically evaluated effective.
Generally, a program fault needs to be exercised to cause infected program states, which are propagated to be finally observed. The PIE Model describes the necessary condition for a program fault becoming a failure revealed. In this work, we, inspired by the PIE model, propose to use def-use chain as the unit of suspiciousness assessment in fault localization. Preliminary results show that our approaching is promising.
