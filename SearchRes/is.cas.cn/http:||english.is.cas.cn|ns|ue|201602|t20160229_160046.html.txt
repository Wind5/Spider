 SKLCS Seminar　　Title: The evolutionary benefits of recombination: A mathematical analysis   　Speaker: Antonio Montalban (UC Berkeley, USA)   　Time: 15:00, January 21st (Thursday), 2016.　　Venue:  Seminar Room (334), Level 3, Building 5, Institute of Software,　　Chinese Academy of Sciences. 　　　　Abstract: We compare the evolutionary benefits of sexual and asexual reproduction from a purely mathematical viewpoint. The model we study concentrates on the most basic features of the process, abstracting out everything else, allowing us to provide a deep and robust reason　for the superiority of sexual reproduction.
