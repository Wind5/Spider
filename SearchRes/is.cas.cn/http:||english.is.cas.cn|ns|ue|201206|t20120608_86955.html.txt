As cloud computing becomes more and more popular, understanding the economics of cloud computing becomes critically important. To maximize the profit, a service provider should understand both service charges and business costs, and how they are determined by the characteristics of the applications and the configuration of a multiserver system. The problem of optimal multiserver configuration for profit maximization in a cloud computing environment is studied. Our pricing model takes such factors into considerations as the amount of a service, the workload of an application environment, the configuration of a multiserver system, the service level agreement, the satisfaction of a consumer, the quality of a service, the penalty of a low quality service, the cost of renting, the cost of energy consumption, and a service providerâ€™s margin and profit. Our approach is to treat a multiserver system as an M/M/m queueing model, such that our optimization problem can be formulated and solved analytically. Two server speed and power consumption models are considered, namely, the idle-speed model and the constant-speed model. The probability density function of the waiting time of a newly arrived service request is derived. The expected service charge to a service request is calculated. The expected net business gain in one unit of time is obtained. Numerical calculations of the optimal server size and the optimal server speed are demonstrated. The work presented in this talk is a joint effort of Junwei Cao, Kai Hwang, Keqin Li, and Albert Y. Zomaya.
