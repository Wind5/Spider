 Title: Quantum Simulation: Challenges and OpportunitiesSpeaker: Man-Hong Yung (IIIS, Tsinghua Univ., China)        iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/~yung        (Postdoc in Harvard, awarded Young 1000 Talent)Time: 27th November 2014, 14:30Venue: Seminar Room (334), Level 3, Building 5, Institute of Software, CASAbstract:Quantum simulation with a quantum computer or quantum devices is a promising solution to overcoming the limitation of classical devices for studying complex physical systems. In recent years, much progress has been made both theoretically and experimentally on how quantum simulation can be made useful. Here I will review several recent works in this area and highlight some works I am involved, and finally point to some directions where further progresses can be made.
