 活动介绍：题目: Bigger data and bigger models for visual recognition and social media 主讲人: Dr. Liangliang Cao时间：5月19日下午14：00地点：软件所5号楼4层第一会议室自由研讨和座谈时间：5月19日下午15：00地点：软件所5号楼4层第一会议室内容介绍：In the past decade, the field of visual recognition has experienced a number of significant changes. The size of the datasets collected by vision researchers has grown substantially. For example, the ImageNet LSVRC dataset in 2010 is 150 times bigger than the Caltech101 dataset in 2003. On the other hand, the visual recognition models also become dramatically bigger. The-state-of-the-art deep CNN models have 1000 times more parameters than the tradition bag of words model in the early 2000s. In this talk, I plan to give a personal overview of these evolvements in visual recognition, and show how modelsdata reinforce each other’s growth. I would like to share our experiences of winning the First Place in ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge 2010 as well as the First Place in ImageCLEF medical image recognition 2012&2013 and examine the influence of scalable techniques in these visual recognition problems. A few our recent demos of visual recognition, text recognition and social media mining will be shown during the talk together with discussions of future research. 主讲人介绍：Dr. Liangliang Cao is a research staff member in IBM T.J. Waston Research Center. He also holds an adjunct faculty position at the Columbia University in the City of New York.
