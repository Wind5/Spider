We study verification of programs for future quantum computers. Quantum programs are modelled by quantum Markov chains (qMCs). Three kinds of long-term behaviours of qMCs are considered of, namely reachability, repeated reachability and persistence. As the major contribution, several (classical) algorithms for computing the reachability, repeated reachability and persistence probabilities of a qMC are presented, and their complexities are analysed.
