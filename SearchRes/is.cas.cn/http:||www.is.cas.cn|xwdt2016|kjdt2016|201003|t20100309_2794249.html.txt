As processes evolve to handle current and future software challenges, so too must software cost estimation techniques and management metrics. Some of these challenges include emergent requirements, rapid change, net-centric system of systems, model-driven system development, service oriented architectures, Brownfield development, always-on never-fail system development, competitive prototyping, and hardware/software/human factors/systems engineering integration. This talk will discuss how these challenges will likely impact cost estimation processes and models, and provide examples of emerging approaches to the challenges.
柏瑞·贝姆教授（Barry W. Boehm）是美国国家工程院院士，AIAA、IEEE、ACM会士（Fellow）。现任美国南加州大学(University of Southern California, USC) TRW软件工程教授，系统与软件工程中心(Center for Systems and Software Engineering, CSSE)的创始人。柏瑞·贝姆教授是软件业中最有影响的专家之一，对软件工程领域做出了诸多杰出贡献，其中包括软件成本估算的COCOMO模型(Constructive Cost Model)、软件过程中的螺旋模型(Spiral Model)、适用于软件管理和需求协商的W理论(win-win)，以及奠定了软件成本估算领域基础的经典著作《软件工程经济学》。他开创并发展的COCOMO模型一直以来引领着软件成本估算技术的发展，在全世界范围内得到了非常广泛的产业应用。被学术和产业界同行尊誉为“软件工程经济学之父”。
Barry W. Boehm, TRW Professor of Software Engineering and Director Emeritus, Center for Software Engineering, University of Southern California.
Barry Boehm received his B.A. degree from Harvard in 1957, and his M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from UCLA in 1961 and 1964, all in Mathematics. He also received an honorary Sc.D. in Computer Science from the U. of Massachusetts in 2000. 
Between 1989 and 1992, he served within the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) as Director of the DARPA Information Science and Technology Office, and as Director of the DDR&E Software and Computer Technology Office. He worked at TRW from 1973 to 1989, culminating as Chief Scientist of the Defense Systems Group, and at the Rand Corporation from 1959 to 1973, culminating as Head of the Information Sciences Department. He was a Programmer-Analyst at General Dynamics between 1955 and 1959. 
His current research interests focus on value-based software engineering, including a method for integrating a software system's process models, product models, property models, and success models called Model-Based (System) Architecting and Software Engineering (MBASE). His contributions to the field include the Constructive Cost Model (COCOMO), the Spiral Model of the software process, the Theory W (win-win) approach to software management and requirements determination, the foundations for the areas of software risk management and software quality factor analysis, and two advanced software engineering environments: the TRW Software Productivity System and Quantum Leap Environment.　 
He has served on the boards of several scientific journals, including the IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering, IEEE Computer, IEEE Software, ACM Computing Reviews, Automated Software Engineering, Software Process, and Information and Software Technology. He has served as Chair of the AIAA Technical Committee on Computer Systems, Chair of the IEEE Technical Committee on Software Engineering, and as a member of the Governing Board of the IEEE Computer Society. He has also served as Chair of the Air Force Scientific Advisory Board's Information Technology Panel, Chair of the NASA Research and Technology Advisory Committee for Guidance, Control, and Information Processing, and Chair of the Board of Visitors for the CMU Software Engineering Institute. 
His honors and awards include Guest Lecturer of the USSR Academy of Sciences (1970), the AIAA Information Systems Award (1979), the J.D. Warnier Prize for Excellence in Information Sciences (1984), the ISPA Freiman Award for Parametric Analysis (1988), the NSIA Grace Murray Hopper Award (1989), the Office of the Secretary of Defense Award for Excellence (1992), the ASQC Lifetime Achievement Award (1994), the ACM Distinguished Research Award in Software Engineering (1997), and the IEEE Harlan D. Mills Award (2000). He is a Fellow of the primary professional societies in computing (ACM), aerospace (AIAA), electronics (IEEE), and systems engineering (INCOSE), and a member of the National Academy of Engineering.
