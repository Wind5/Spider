 　　Title：TextScope: Enhance Human Perception via Text Mining 　　Time：2017-6-23 2:00 PM　　Venue：2nd Meeting Room , Level 4, Building 5 　　Speaker：Prof. ChengXiang Zhai, University of Illinois，Urbana-Champaign 　　Abstract： 　　Recent years have seen a dramatic growth of natural language text data. Similar todata generated by a computer system or sensors, text can be regarded as thedata generated by humans (as subject intelligent "sensors" of theworld) to describe the observed world. As such, text data contain all kinds ofknowledge about the world as well as human opinions and preferences, thusproviding a great opportunity for mining large amounts of text data ("bigtext data") to discovery useful knowledge that can support various tasks,especially those involving complex decision-making. 　　In this talk, I will present the vision of developing an intelligent text miningtool, called TextScope, to support interactive text mining. Just as amicroscope allows us to see things in the micro world,and a telescope allows usto see things far away, the TextScope would allow us to finding useful hiddenknowledge buried in large amounts of text data that would otherwise be unknownto us. As examples of techniques that can be used to build a TextScope, I willpresent a few general statistical text mining algorithms that we have developedfor joint analysis of text and non-text data to discover interesting patternsand knowledge. I will also briefly discuss the challenges in developing aTextScope and some important directions for future research. 　　  　　Bio: ChengXiang Zhai is a Professor of Computer Science and a Willett Faculty Scholar at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, where he is also affiliated with School of Information Sciences, Carl R. Woese Institute for Genomic Biology, and Department of Statistics.
