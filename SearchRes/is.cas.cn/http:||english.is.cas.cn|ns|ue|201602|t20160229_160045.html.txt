 [12-28]Graph Processing and Mining in the Era of Big Data 
 Title:  Graph Processing and Mining in the Era of Big DataTime：10:00am, Dec. 28th, 2015Venue：Middle Meeting Room, Level 4, Building 5Speaker：　　Prof Chengqi Zhang　　Director, Centre for Quantum Computation & Intelligent Systems (QCIS)　　University of Technology Sydney　　Australia　　　　Abstract：  　　With the emergence and rapid proliferation of applications that deal with big graphs, such as web graphs (Google, Yahoo), social networks (Facebook, Twitter), e-commerce networks (Amazon, Ebay), and road networks, graph processing and mining has become increasingly prevalent and important in recent years. However, in the era of big data, the explosion and profusion of available graph data in a wide range of application domains rise up new challenges and opportunities in graph processing and mining.Graph processing and mining is one of the research strengths in the centre for Quantum Computation and Intelligent Systems (QCIS) at the University of Technology, Sydney (UTS).  In this talk, I will first investigate the new challenges for graph processing and mining in the era of big data. To tackle these challenges, I will introduce the recent research developments in QCIS in terms of new graph query semantics, new graph mining tasks, new query processing algorithms, new graph indexing techniques, and new computing paradigms. Finally, I will show our current achievements in building a general-purpose graph processing and mining system in QCIS centre, and discuss our potential future research directions.　　　Bio： 　　Chengqi Zhang has been appointed as a Research Professor of Information Technology at The University of Technology Sydney (UTS) since December 2001.
