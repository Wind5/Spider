Abstract:In 1998, Paturi, Pudlak, Saks, and Zane presented PPSZ, an elegant randomized algorithm for k-SAT. Fourteen years on, this algorithm is still the fastest known worst-case algorithm. We give the first nontrivial lower bounds on its running time. We show that its worst case running time is at least 2^(c * n), where c is a constant depending on k that converges to 1 as k grows.
