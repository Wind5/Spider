 Title：A Bridge Between Desktop Grids and Service Grids Speaker：Dr. Haiwu HETime：15：00-15：30 pm, July 24Venue：Room 337 
Dr.Haiwu HE has an research engineer expert position in INRIA.He got his Masters degree and Ph.D in LIFL (Laboratoire dInformatique Fondamentale de Lille) of University of Sciences and Technologies of Lille USTL (Lille I ). The main subjects of his Ph.D Program are supercomputing algorithms, high performance P2P computing and Grid computing.He is working on an OpenSource Middleware for Data Desktop Grids: BitDew.He is now also a research scientist of European FP7 project EDGeS(Enabling Desktop Grids for e-Science) aiming to work on bridge from "institutional" grid such as EGEE to desktop grids such as BOINC, and XtremWeb. 
Desktop grids and service grids widely used by their different users communities as efficient solutions for making full use of computing power and achieving loads balances across Intranet or Internet. Nevertheless,little work has been done to combine these two girds technologies together to establish a seamless and vast grid resources pool. In this paper we will present a new European FP7 infrastructure project:EDGeS(Enabling Desktop Grids for e-Science),which aim to build technological bridges to facilitate interoperability between desktop grid and service grid. We give also a taxonomy of existing grid systems: desktop grids such as BONIC and XtremWeb, service grids such as EGEE. Then we describe furtherly our solution for identifying translation technologies for porting applications between desktop grids and service grids, and vice versa. There are three themes in our solution, which discuss actual popular bridging technologies, user access issues, and distributed data issues about deployment and application development.
