 [7-27]Integrative Network Analytics for Insights Generation from Massive Healthcare Data 
 Title: Integrative Network Analytics for Insights Generation from Massive Healthcare Data Speaker：Dr. Fei Wang  Time：2016-7-27,  9:30 AMVenue：No.2 Meeting Room , Level 4, Bulding 5,ISCAS Abstract:　　        The arrival of the Precision Medicine age brings tremendous opportunities to scientific discovery and quality improvement in medicine and healthcare. However, it also raises big challenges in dealing with large and massive healthcare data from heterogeneous sources. In this talk, I will present a computational framework called integrative network analytics to generate insights from complex healthcare data including Electronic Health Records (EHR), drug development data, genomic data, etc. I will also demonstrate how such framework can be used in computational drug discovery and personalized treatment recommendation. 　　　　　　　　　      　　    　　    Bio:　　         Fei Wang is an Assistant Professor in Division of Health Informatics, Department of Healthcare Policy and Research, Cornell University.
