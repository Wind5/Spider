Title: Hunting Bugs in General-Purpose and High-Performance SystemsSpeaker: Feng Qinï¼ŒAssistant Professor at Ohio State University

Abstract:Computer systems are playing increasingly important roles in our society. Unfortunately, software bugs severely hurt their reliability. Our research focuses on devising system mechanisms to survive, prevent, detect, and expose software bugs at different software development stages. In this talk, I will mainly present our work LeakSurvivor, which is to safely tolerate memory leaks in programs running on general-purpose systems. It does so by directly swapping objects between virtual memory and disks. Our experimental results show that LeakSurivivor can survive programs from continuous memory leaks while sustaining relatively good performance. Additionally, I will discuss our work FlowChecker and 2ndStrike for detecting and exposing software bugs, respectively.
Bio:Feng Qin received his Ph.D. degree from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. He joined the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at Ohio State as an Assistant Professor in 2006. His research interests include Software Reliability, Operating Systems, High Performance Computing, and Security. He is particularly interested in developing system mechanisms to improve software availability and reliability at different software development stages. He has published papers in top system conferences in recent years. One of his papers was awarded as best papers in SOSP'05. Two of his papers won IEEE Micro Top Picks in 2004 and 2007, respectively. Three of his papers were nominated as best papers in HPCA'05, SC'07, and SC'10, respectively. He has received NSF CAREER Award in 2010.
