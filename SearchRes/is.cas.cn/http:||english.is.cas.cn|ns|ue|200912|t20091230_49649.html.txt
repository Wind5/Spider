Abstract：It seems that Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) is becoming a new buzzword in the community of information engineering for the next few years. People in  Europe use the term ``ensemble engineering'' to define the  same area of research. In 2006, the American NSF identified CPS as a top priority funding research area for the next 15 year, and in 2007-2008,  the EC  InterLink Working Group on Software Intensive Systems and New Programming  Paradigms also proposed Ensemble Engineering as the research direction through the  future calls for grant applications in the next 15-20 years. Thought leaders in China too, have started talking about CPS.This informal talk intends to share some reflections on the discussions about Ensemble Engineering at the  InterLink  Workshops  I attended, and  initiate some discussions on the distinguished features, challenges in CPS, and the current related areas of research. It is not its intention to reach any conclusion about the future of CPS.
