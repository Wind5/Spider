 Speaker: Prof. Albert Lawrence, University of California, USA Time: 15:00pmâ€”16:00pm, October 13th, 2011 (Thursday) Place: Room 1234, 12th Floor, ICT, CAS
Abstract: During the course of this presentation Dr. Lawrence will focus on the role of high performance computing and advanced mathematical algorithms in 3D reconstructions from electron microscope data. High quality reconstructions are essential to the integration of genomic data, unraveling metabolic pathways in molecular biology and elucidating the cellular ultrastructure in a functional context. In addition to solving the Radon inversion problem when the trajectories of the electrons are curvilinear, Dr Lawrence has developed techniques to deal with the problems of noise, artifact and incomplete data in EM tomography.
Bio: Dr. Lawrence received his PhD in pure mathematics from the University of Chicago in 1969. Since then he has spent much of his career bridging the gap between biology and mathematics. With the advent of large scale image processing opportunities for cooperation between mathematics and biologists have increased dramatically. Dr Lawrence has taken advantage of this and in recent years has developed an advanced code for electron microscope tomography. This code, like all good turnkey production codes has a fully automated version which is invisible to the user.
