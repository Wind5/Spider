Speaker: Dr. Matthew Andrews, Alcatel-Lucent Bell Labs, USATime: 9:30amâ€”10:30am, August 18th, 2010 (Wednesday)Place: Room 446, 4th Floor, ICT, CASAbstract: In this talk we shall consider a number of resource allocation problems that arise in the design and operation of 4th generation wireless data networks. These networks are typically based on an OFDM physical layer and so we need to assign resources across the three domains of time, frequency and power.  Some example questions that we shall consider are:* How can we efficiently schedule multiple frequencies so that we never overallocate resources to any individual user in the network?* How can we make wireless networks more energy efficient by introducing small radius cells?* What is the best way to share spectrum between low-power small-radius cells and high-power large-radius cells?Bio:Matthew Andrews is a Distinguished Member of Technical Staff in the Math of Networks and Communications Department at Alcatel-Lucent Bell Labs in Murray Hill, New Jersey, USA. He received his B.A. in mathematics from Oxford University, UK in 1993 and his Ph.D. in theoretical computer science from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1997. His research interests include wireless resource allocation, packet scheduling and approximation algorithms. His recent work includes resource allocation algorithms for 4th generation wireless networks and complexity theoretic results on the hardness of network design. He is the holder of 8 telecommunications patents and is the author of over 80 papers that have appeared in conferences including ACM STOC, IEEE FOCS, ACM MOBICOM, IEEE INFOCOM and journals including J. ACM, IEEE/ACM Trans. on Networking, SIAM J. on Computing. He has recently served on the program committees for FOCS, SODA and INFOCOM and he has just received the FOCS 2010 Best Paper Award for his work on the Edge-Disjoint Paths problem.
