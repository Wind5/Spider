摘要：We have entered a data explosion era, and the amount data in digital formant worldwide is reaching to Exabyte. High performance and cost-effective storage systems are critical to address various challenges in the human society overflowing with data. Flash memory based solid state drive (SSD) is a pivotal technology that has a potential to fundamentally change the existing computer storage systems. The unique physical nature of SSDs brings several desirable merits, such as low-latency random accesses, low power consumption, and shock resistance. However, the performance potential cannot be automatically exploited without extensive research efforts. We have identified several critical issues in SSD to address: (1) performance bottlenecks caused by unpredicted and dynamic data layouts, (2) limited capacity and relatively high price, and (3) resource underutilization caused by lacking the insights into internal structures and functionalities. In this talk, I will present a set of system solutions, aiming at effectively tap the performance power of SSDs. In particular, I will discuss experimental techniques to detect the SSD internal structures, an enhancement of operating system to seamlessly integrate SSDs into the existing storage hierarchy, and a software library to exploit the rich internal parallelism of SSDs. The integrated three components provide necessary services to a high performance and cost-effective hybrid storage system. Experimental performance will be presented to show the effectiveness of our research. This work is done with Feng Chen at Ohio State in collaboration with Intel Research Lab.
