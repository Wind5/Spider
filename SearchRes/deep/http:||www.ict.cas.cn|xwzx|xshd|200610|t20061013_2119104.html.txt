摘要：   Network becomes the engine of scientific research activities in 21st century. Networks interact with one another and are recursive. For example, social networks are built upon information networks which built upon communications networks which in turn are built on physical networks. Moreover, this layered structure of interaction built on top of other networks is reflected directly in the diversity of communities: sociologists, managements, economists, biologists, chemists, physicists, and a wide variety of engineers. Getting so many diverse groups to agree on a common core of knowledge about networks is a significant challenge to both cognitive science and artificial intelligence.  Until 1990s we had no alternative for describing our interlinked universe but random graphics. Unfortunately complex real networks are unable to be viewed as pure random. Watts and Strogatz proposed the small world model, and Barabási and Albert proved the topology of most complex networks may follow a power-law  degree distribution. “Small worlds” and “power law distributions” are generic properties of networks in general. Therefore, network intelligence and networked intelligence become very active recently. Mining typical topologies, discovering sensitive links and important communities from real complex networks, network control systems, and making a virtual reality of emergence phenomenon in complex systems are all important issues in network intelligence. Some specific implementations and examples will be given in this talk.
