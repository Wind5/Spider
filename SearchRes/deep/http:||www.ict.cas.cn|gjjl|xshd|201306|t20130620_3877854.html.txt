Pan教授 Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering The University of Texas at Austin, TX 78712 摘要 As the CMOS feature enters the era of extreme scaling (14nm, 11nm and beyond), the printability challenges are exacerbated. Meanwhile, the vertical scaling with 3D-IC integration using through-silicon-vias (TSVs) has gained tremendous momentum and initial industry adoption, which can further extend the Moore’s Law even the horizontal scaling stops ultimately. However, as TSV involves disruptive manufacturing technologies, new modeling and design techniques need to be developed for reliable 3D IC integration. This talk will first show how the nanolithography envelope is being pushed with novel design/process integration for multiple patterning lithography as well as other emerging technologies. In 3D-IC, TSV induced thermal mechanical stress not only results in systematic performance variations, but also leads to mechanical and electrical reliability concerns. Cross-layer full-chip/package modeling and physical design/synthesis techniques will be discussed to achieve reliable 3D-IC integration. A new NSF/SRC program on Failure-Resistant Systems will be discussed as well. 主讲人简介： David Z. Pan received his Ph.D. in computer science from UCLA in 2000. He was a Research Staff Member at IBM T. J.
