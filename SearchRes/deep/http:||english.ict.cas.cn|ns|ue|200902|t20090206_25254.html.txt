Google Research, NY was officially founded 4 years ago. Since then it has grown significantly, centering its activities around large-scale machine learning and statistical analysis, algorithms for auctioning, and speech recognition. In this talk, we will give a short overview of some of the projects the group has worked on, including applications in vision, NLP, and GOOG-411. 
Corinna Cortes is the Head of Google Research, NY where she is working on a broad range of theoretical and applied large-scale machine learning problems. Prior to Google, Corinna spent more than ten years at AT&T Labs - Research, formerly AT&T Bell Labs, where she held a distinguished research position. Corinnas research work is well-known in particular for her contributions to the theoretical foundations of support vector machines (SVMs) and her work on data-mining in very large data sets for which she was awarded the AT&T Science and Technology Medal in the year 2000. Corinna received her MS degree in Physics from the Niels Bohr Institute in Copenhagen and joined AT&T Bell Labs as a researcher in 1989. She received her Ph.D. in computer science from the University of Rochester in 1993. Corinna is also a competitive runner, placing third in the More Marathon in New York City in 2005, and a mother of two. Michael Riley received his B.S., M.S. and Ph.D. in computer science from MIT. He joined Bell Labs in Murray Hill, NJ in 1987 and moved to AT&T Labs in Florham Park, NJ in 1996. He is currently a member of the research staff at Google, Inc. in New York City. His interests include speech and natural language processing, text analysis, information retrieval, and machine learning.
