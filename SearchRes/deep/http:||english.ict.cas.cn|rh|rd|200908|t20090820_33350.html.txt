ã€€ The Microprocessor Technology Research Center is mainly engaged in the research on Loongson series high-performance general-purpose CPU chips, SoCs, and related technologies. Its main research areas include: high-performance processor architecture, IP and SoC design technology, low-power processor design technology, processor verification and test technology, nano-ICs design technology, high-speed signal transmission technology, etc. 
Through years of R&D and application popularization, the Center has gradually turned to work on Loongson-1 series CPU and its IP, orienting embedded system application, Loongson-2 series CPU and its IP, orienting high-end embedded and desktop application, and Loongson-3 series multi-core CPU for server and high-performance computer application. The Center successfully built Loongson-1 in 2002, which was the first high-performance general-purpose processor in China; in 2006, it successfully built Loongson-2E processor with 1GHz frequency, which achieved a SPEC CPU2000 score of 500; in October 2009, it successfully developed Loogson-3A, which was the first multi-core general-purpose processor in China.
