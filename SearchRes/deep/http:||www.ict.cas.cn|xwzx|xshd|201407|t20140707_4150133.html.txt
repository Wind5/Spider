By saving two or more digital bits in one storage element, MLC design doubles or even triples the data storage density and hence has been widely adopted in memory technologies. The use of MLC in STT-RAM caches, however, encounters a number of design challenges, including the limited density benefit of the MLC design and the degraded performance and reliability induced by the multi-step accesses. Our latest research outcomes on these topics will be presented and discussed.　　 　　主讲人简介　　Hai Li received B.S. and M.S. from Tsinghua University and Ph.D. from Purdue University.
