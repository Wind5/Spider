摘 要：  Large software systems infrastructures for distributed systems increasingly suffer from complex development and suboptimal performance. Our observations show that this problem is mostly caused by many inherently non-modular features only applicable in specific application contexts. In this talk I present our solutions to this problem by first describing the fundamentals of the aspect oriented programming paradigm. I then present an algorithm aiming at the automatic discovery of non-modularity in the sources of large software systems. I present the aspect oriented library approach for concurrency to be supported and evolved separately from Java server programs. I present the quantitative evaluations using both system benchmarks and software engineering metrics and show that our approaches benefit both the development and computational efficiency of software infrastructures.
