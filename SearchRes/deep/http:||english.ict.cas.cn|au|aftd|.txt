The first-generation administration of the People’s Republic of China foresaw the significance of information technology in the 1950’s and founded the Institute of Computing Technology (ICT) inside the Chinese Academy of Sciences as one of the national urgent measures.Since its establishment, the ICT has made historic contributions to the advancement of computing technology in China. As we entered the 21st century, the rapid development of information technology and knowledge economy has given the ICT unprecedented growth opportunities. To stay ahead for the future, the ICT will carry though the new-era principles enacted by the Chinese Academy of Sciences. The ICT will reinforce its ability to produce original innovations for key technologies, concentrate its resources to accomplish large undertakings, and consider both the national interests and market viability while continuously delivering strategic, advanced, and seminal accomplishments.
To heed the call of “Innovation 2020”, the ICT has formulated a three-fold mission for the incoming decade: promoting the advancement of computing technology disciplines, including computer systems, computer networks, and computer intelligence; engaging in all aspects of the research and development of commercially viable high technology -- academic research, indigenous innovation, technology transformation, and industrialization; playing an irreplaceable role in the information industry value chain and elevating China’s information industry to a higher level.
We will unswervingly uphold our core values, first formed during the project of Knowledge Innovation, “Research for a stronger nation, Innovation for a better society”, and uphold our motto “integrity, openness, and tenacity”. We will spare no effort in creating a culture of excellence – raising our limits from being outstanding to being the best, building a harmonious and continuously advancing “greater ICT”, promoting “everyone is uniquely talented and equally deserves happiness” philosophy, and striving to make the ICT a well-recognized world-class research institute and an unmistakable leader in the development path of China's information industry and information technology.
