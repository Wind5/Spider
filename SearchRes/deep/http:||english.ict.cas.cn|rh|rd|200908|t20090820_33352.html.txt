ã€€The Research Center of Web Data Science & Engineering is devoted to the research on theories, technologies, and systems for cyberspace-oriented large-scale data acquirement, processing and service platforms, and for strategic applications and related areas oriented to content security, Internet search, etc. The Center has set 5 key research directions, namely, cloud computing systems and fundamental facilities, network search and mining, public sentiment computing and content security service, network emulation and secure application, and network science and fundamental theory of social computing.
In recent years, the Center has published and presented hundreds of academic papers in important international journals and at international symposiums, all about its achievements such as grid systems, Internet search systems, public sentiment supervision systems, network data mining algorithm and systems, information content security management systems, etc., which has made important impact both at home and internationally. Scientific research achievements involved have won national-level and ministry-level awards, including 1 first prize and 2 second prizes for National Science and Technology Progress. A great number of these achievements have been applied in many fields such as national cyberspace information content security ensurance, Chinese national grid, Internet search and service, government informatization, etc. 
The strategic goals of the Center have been set to build cyberspace-oriented distributed mass data processing core engines, computing models and national-level testbeds, to bring about important application outputs in the sectors of network public sentiment systems, socialized search engines, data-intensive network service, large-scale network computing basic facilities, etc., and to create academic teams with important international influence in the sectors of network science and social computing methods, information network computing models and mechanisms,etc.
