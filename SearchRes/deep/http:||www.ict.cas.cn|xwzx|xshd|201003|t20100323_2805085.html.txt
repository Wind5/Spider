摘要：　Conventionally, FPGA devices are used as either glue logic or data interface. However, the full potential of FPGA is much more beyond these conventional applications. In this presentation, several topics, loosely categorized into “unconventional” applications are discussed. The examples are extracted from real high energy physics applications including waveform digitization, data compression, filtering and reconfigurable computing in FPGA. The presentation is designed for general physicist/engineer audience.
