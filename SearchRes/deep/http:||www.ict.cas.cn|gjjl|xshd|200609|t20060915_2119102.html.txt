演讲内容1、面向知识发现和问题求解的统计学习: 基本问题、主要挑战、和统一理论Statistical Learning on Knowledge Discovery and Problem Solving: Fundamentals, Challenges, and A Unified Theory香港中文大学讲座教授、IEEE Fellow、国际模式识别学会Fellow、欧洲科学院院士发现知识和求解问题是一个生物或人工系统体现其智能的两个特征能力。这两个能力是该系统在与所处环境的交互过程中通过学习获得的。基于从环境中获得的有限个事例(或称为样本)为媒介，具有不确定性是这种学习的固有本质，须以统计方法为基础，故称之为统计学习。统计学习的基本问题,由其三个基本要素之间的相互关系所决定，归纳为两个主要挑战。本报告的主题包括两点，一是系统地勾画几十年来统计学习的发展轮廓,介绍学术界分别针对每个主要挑战所做出的努力和取得的进展。二是大致地介绍本报告者十余年来，所提出和发展起来的一个统计学习之统一理论体系，称为贝叶斯阴阳和谐学习系统和理论，用以解决两个主要挑战的课题。最后,还针对模式识别、图像处理、神经网络、数据发掘、生物信息学等领域中的一个基础课题,既复杂数据中多结构发掘、多目标识别、和多推断综合之统计学习, 简略地介绍本报告者在过去二十年来从四个方向上系统地进行研究所获得的若干结果。
2、A Unified Perspective  and New Results on RHT Computing, Mixture Based Learning, and  A General Problem Solving Paradigm  　  Chair professor of  Chinese Univ Hong Kong,  IEEE Fellow　 and a Fellow of International Association for Pattern Recognition, and a member of European Academy of Sciences  　  On one hand,  multiple　 object detection approaches of Hough transform (HT) and Randomized HT types　 have been extended into an evidence accumulation featured general framework for problem solving, with five key  mechanisms elaborated and several  extensions of HT and RHT presented. On the other hand, another framework is proposed to integrate  typical multi-learner based approaches for  problem solving, particularly on  Gaussian mixture based  data clustering and local subspace learning, multi-sets mixture based object detection and motion estimation, and multi-agent coordinated problem solving. Typical learning algorithms, especially those based on Rival Penalized Competitive Learning (RPCL) and  Bayesian Ying-Yang (BYY) learning, are summarized from  a unified perspective  with new extensions. Furthermore, the two different frameworks are not only examined with one viewed crossly from a perspective of the other, with new insights and extensions, but also  further unified into a general problem solving paradigm that　 consists of five basic mechanisms in terms of　 acquisition, allocation, amalgamation, admission, and affirmation}, or shortly  A5 paradigm.
