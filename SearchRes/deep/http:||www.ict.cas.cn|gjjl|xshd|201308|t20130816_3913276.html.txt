To do this, it explicitly models and learns user preferences while interacting with users, continuously monitors time varying candidate items and user context, and recommend the most relevant items to a specific user when appropriate. In this talk, we will present our work on combining Bayesian statistical machine learning and economics theories to help the software agent decide what to recommend and when to recommend based on Bayesian hierarchical models. Experimental results in various applications (e-commerce, restaurants, etc.) will be presented and discussed.主讲人简介Yi Zhang is an Associate Professor in School of Engineering at University of California Santa Cruz, with affiliation in Technology Management Department, Computer Science Department, Applied Math and Statistics Department, and Economics Department.
