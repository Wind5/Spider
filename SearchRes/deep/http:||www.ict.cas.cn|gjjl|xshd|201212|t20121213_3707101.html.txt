In this talk, I present several effective routing techniques for low-dimensional interconnects, such as, meshes/tori. I  shall introduce some routing schemes, such as IPAR, an new planar adaptive routing method, and the channel overlap scheme for meshes. The channel overlap is a new virtual network deadlock avoidance technique that assign some common virtual channels to different virtual networks.  After that, I shall introduce a new fully adaptive routing technique for tori with two virtual channels. A new flow control scheme is then introduced for fully adaptive deadlock-free routing in tori, where each input port requires two buffers, but no virtual channels. The routing techniques for the current high-radix interconnects, such as, PERCS and dragonfly interconnects, are also discussed. I shall show that many potential rooms exist to improve the routing shemes in current high-radix interconnects.
