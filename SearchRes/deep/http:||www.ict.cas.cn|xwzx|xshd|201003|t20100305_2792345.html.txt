摘要：In this talk, I will summarize a number of steam data mining problems, Active Labeling, Cleansing, and Vague Learning, we have addressed in recent years. For active labeling, we consider that labeling all stream data is expensive and impractical, and our objective is to label a small portion of stream data from which a model is derived to predict newly arrived instances as accurate as possible. For data streams containing incorrectly labeled training samples, we propose a Maximum Variance Margin principle to accurately identify and remove mislabeled data, such that the prediction models built from the cleansed streams can be more accurate than the ones trained from the raw noisy streams. For vague learning in data streams, we allow users to label instance groups, instead of single instances, as positive samples for learning. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world data demonstrate the performances of the proposed efforts in comparison with other simple approaches.
