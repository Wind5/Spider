摘要： Sustainability has become an emerging area of study in the past few years. Two forces are behind this growing interest. The first is that many government agencies are enforcing new regulations requiring companies to be accountable for their operations in meeting sustainability. The other is the global awareness toward global warming and the societal demands for green business. It has been generally agreed that information and communication technology (ICT) can be used to improve the efficiency of industrial and business operations for both cost and energy concerns. We investigate a real-time SOA framework to enhance sustainability and predictability in industrial systems. The proposed real-time SOA middleware builds the support for accountability reasoning and global resource management for real-time service processes. Given a service plan and known resource constraints, the middleware monitors the performance and reserves resources in advance for each service in the process to ensure its real-time feasibility.
