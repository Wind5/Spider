As the amount of data we are actively managing continues to expand at around 20% per year, enterprise organizations are experiencing a massive growth of data storage demands. They have to ensure that these increasing volumes are easily managed, while still being highly available and affordable. In this talk, I will highlight some of the key storage technologies, including storage architecture that moves from DAS to NAS/SAN, virtualization to ease management of aggregate storage pools that use available capability more efficiently, data protections for ensuring information integrity, high-availability clusters for minimizing the down-time, and file system architecture in the state-of-art storage systems. These technologies enable IT to grow through better use of their existing assets and more efficient management of ever-expanding storage data. As storage evolves to meet the increasing demands from the businesses and applications, there are some major trends in the storage technology industry for 2012 that will also be covered in this talk.
