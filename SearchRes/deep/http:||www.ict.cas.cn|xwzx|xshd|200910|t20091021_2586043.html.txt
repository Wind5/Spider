　　摘要：　Today, Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) has become a universal digital electronics design platform.  The applications of FPGA range from merely glue logic, to data processing interface, to flexible fabric for high performance scientific computing.  An inconvenient truth of Moore’s Law is that the speed of high end microprocessors has stopped increasing a few years ago after seemingly endless progress for several decades.  In this age, badly demanded explorations of more efficient computing architectures are enabled by the ultra-flexibility of FPGA.  In this talk, several application examples in computing with FPGA are discussed.
