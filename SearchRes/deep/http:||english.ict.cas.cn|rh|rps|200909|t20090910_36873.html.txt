Name of project: Theory and Method of Service-Aware Oriented Network Measurement Source of Project: project supported by 973 Program of the Ministry of Science and Technology Person in Charge: Xie Gaogang Project Profile:  The measurement of network running, resources organization and service behavioral characteristics is the foundation for network management, optimization and control, and is also the precondition for the research of new type network system architecture. IP network, due to mobility, heterogeneity and high bandwidth and along with the development of new type service, is getting more and more complicated. However, IP protocol based design aims at simplicity and scalability, and does not take into consideration testability at all in the course of design. There are a series of technical issues for conventional network measurement and analysis approach to break through urgently in terms of high speed collection, service identification, monitoring granularity, index transmission, modeling, etc. Therefore, network measurement, analysis and modeling is the most significant challenge and opportunity in current network research, and is in the meantime one of the basic scientific issues calling for urgent resolution. The Project intends to carry out research into the theory and method of service-aware oriented IP network measurement, make in-depth analysis of the diversity of network operation and service, build accurate network and service behavior model, design method for high speed network flow control and resources optimization, and lay a foundation for the construction of measurable, manageable and controllable IP network.
