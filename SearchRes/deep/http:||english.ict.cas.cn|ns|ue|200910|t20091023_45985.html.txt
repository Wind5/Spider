Speaker:Christian S. JensenCenter for Data-Intensive Systems (Daisy)Department of Computer Scienceï¼ŒAalborg University Time: 9:30am, 2009.10.16Place: Room 446,4th Floor, Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of SciencesAbstract:The evolving mobile Internet will be "bigger" than the conventional Internet. User context is expected to be important on the mobile Internet, with user location being a prominent aspect of the context. We are also witnessing a movement towards cloud computing and outsourcing of data management functionality. The talk covers a query-location privacy solution that offers location privacy at low cost and enables trade-offs that involve the amount of privacy, the query cost, and the query accuracy. If time permits, the talk will also cover briefly a solution to the problem of outsourcing the management of private spatial data. The challenge is how to ensure that the data is private and thus "hidden" from the service provider while also supporting the efficient querying of the data. Bio:  Christian S. Jensen is a Professor of Computer Science at Aalborg University, Denmark. His research concerns data management and spans issues of semantics, modeling, and performance. He is an IEEE Fellow and a member of the Danish Academy of Technical Sciences, the EDBT Endowment, and the VLDB Endowment's Board of Trustees. He is an editor-in-chief of The VLDB Journal and has served on the editorial boards of ACM TODS, IEEE TKDE, and the IEEE Data Engineering Bulletin. He was PC chair or co-chair for SSTD 2001, EDBT 2002, VLDB 2005, MobiDE 2006, MDM 2007, and TIME 2008. During the academic year 2008/2009, he was on sabbatical at Google Inc., Mountain View, where he was part of the structured data research group headed by Alon Halevy.
