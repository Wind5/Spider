　　摘要：　The world is currently experiencing an explosion of data. As data is being generated at an exponential rate, it would lose its value unless important conclusions can be quickly extracted. Visualization, an interactive computation process that converts data to graphical images, has become an indispensable tool to seek novel domain-specific understanding. Dr. Gao will highlight some of her other work in data visualization. This will include her proposal for a scalable visibility culling algorithm suitable for parallel and distributed environments. To minimize data access time and support users with a variety of local computing capabilities, this algorithm supports adaptive data selection utilizing both visibility culling and multi-resolution data selection. In addition, she will introduce her data management middleware, which dynamically accesses and streams a minimally necessary subset of any given data to any user requesting an interactive visualization session. This middleware is effective in supporting remote users and is currently under being used to develop support for web-based interactive visualization.
