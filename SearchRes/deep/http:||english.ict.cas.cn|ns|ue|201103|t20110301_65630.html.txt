Abstract: The Internet-of-Things paradigm envisions deploying advanced sensing technologies in every corner of peopleâ€™s life, and utilizing the collected information to enable intelligent decision making. An essential substrate underlying this vision is a middleware layer that is capable of analyzing massive and continuous data streams and delivering the processed information to end applications. Stream processing represents an important form of such in-network messages processing. In existing distributed stream processing systems, high availability (HA) against unexpected failures are handled by either active standby or passive standby. Our study provides an in-depth analysis of the tradeoff between active and passive standby approaches under practical settings. We find that passive standby presents a different tradeoff from active standby: longer recovery time, but 90% less overhead. We further propose a novel hybrid HA method that switches between active and passive standby modes depending on the occurrence of failure events. It achieves low overhead during normal conditions and fast recovery upon transient or permanent failure events. Experiment results show that the hybrid method can reduce two-thirds of the recovery time compared to passive standby and 80% message overhead compared to active standby, providing applications with uninterrupted processing without paying a high premium.
