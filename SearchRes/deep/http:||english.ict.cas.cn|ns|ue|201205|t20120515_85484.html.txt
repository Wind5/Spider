Speaker: Prof. Lusheng Wang, City University of Hong Kong Time: 13:00pmâ€”14:00pm, May 15th, 2012 (Tuesday) Place: Room1234, 12th Floor, ICT, CAS Abstract: In this talk, we will discuss some fixed parameter algorithms for the closest string problem and the shared center problem. The closest string problem has applications in motif detection, PCR primer design etc. The shared center problem is formulated to solve the mutation region detection problem.
