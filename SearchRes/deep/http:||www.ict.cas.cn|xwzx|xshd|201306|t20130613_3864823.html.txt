 报告时间：2013年6月17日上午10点 报告地点：计算所446会议室 报告人：何炳胜 （Nanyang Technological University，Singapore) 摘要： Big data have posed various research challenges in data management systems. In this talk, I will present our recent research efforts in making big data management systems faster and greener. Particularly, two studies will be presented: one is to optimize the efficiency of large graph processing performance in the cloud, and the other is to leverage renewable energy in database systems aiming at zero-emission databases. Finally, I will outline our research agenda in architecting the future faster and green big data management systems. 报告人简历： Dr. Bingsheng He is currently an Assistant Professor at Division of Networks and Distributed Systems, School of Computer Engineering, Nanyang Technological University.
