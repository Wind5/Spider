Abstract: Emerging memory technologies, such as Phase-Change RAM (PCRAM) and Magnetic RAM (MRAM), have the potential to revolutionize modern computer system designs. By combing the speed of SRAM, the density of DRAM, and the non-volatility of Flash memory, these emerging memory technologies demonstrated a great potential to be the candidates for future memory hierarchy design. As such emerging memory technologies are getting mature, many questions are raised for better utilizing them to improve the performance/power/ reliability of future computing systems. For example, how to model such emerging memory technologies? What will be the impacts on the future memory hierarchy? What are the research challenges to overcome for such a new memory hierarchy? What will be the novel applications/architectures with emerging memory technologies? This talk will present ongoing work that tries to answer those questions. First, the speaker will provide an overview of architectural modeling techniques for emerging memory technologies. Next, the speaker will describe novel architectural techniques that exploit these new memory technologies in computer memory hierarchies. Finally, novel applications that leverage the unique benefits of these emerging memory technologies will be presented.
