报告摘要：Nonlinear optimization is an important problem in computational science with abundant applications. Recently, constraint partitioning has been proposed as an efficient approach to solve large-scale nonlinear optimization problems by automatically exploiting the constraint structures. This approach has raised research opportunities for solving difficult, large-scale applications and developing high-performance nonlinear optimization solvers.   This talk discusses new applications of large-scale nonlinear optimization and recent advances in developing stochastic and parallel solvers based on the constraint partitioning approach. The talk reviews some important application domains of nonlinear optimization from molecular biology, medical treatment planning, data mining, and reasoning under uncertainty. The talk analyzes the constraint structure of the applications and shows that all these applications have strongly localized and clustered constraints that are suitable for constraint partitioning. Further, this talk presents new search algorithms under the constraint partitioning paradigm. The talk presents recent advances in stochastic global optimization using simulated annealing and parallel nonlinear optimization that implements the constraint partitioning approach on high-performance parallel and distributed computing architectures.
