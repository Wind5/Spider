LBIST offers a number of benefits, including the elimination of automatic test equipments (ATEs) and at-speed testing of circuits. However, in order to reduce the hardware overhead of storing the fault-free responses on chip, the responses are compressed which makes diagnosis extremely difficult. A diagnosis-friendly LBIST architecture can render LBIST to be more widely adoptable.  　　In this presentation, we will discuss how invariants are extracted from the fault free responses, which are subsequently used as property monitors. During the test session, if any property is violated then the failing vector and property number is stored for offline diagnosis. Experimental results have shown that the architecture is able to achieve diagnosis resolution similar to that in a non-BIST setup　　主讲人简介　　Michael S.
