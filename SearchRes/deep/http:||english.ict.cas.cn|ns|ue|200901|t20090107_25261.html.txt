Inviter:Professor Wen-Lian Hsu is a Distinguished Research Fellow in the Institute of Information Science, Academia Sinica. Time: 3:00pm-4:30pm,Jan 12ï¼Œ2009 (MON)Place:301,Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences
Abstract:We shall illustrate several techniques attacking protein structure as well as function prediction problems. For structure prediction, we shall focus on secondary structure prediction, and membrane helical structure prediction. For function prediction, we shall consider the related subcellular localization prediction. Also, we shall demonstrate a knowledge-based approach for both structure and function prediction. Our approach produces a subset of residues that are more important than others in a protein sequence.
Bio:Professor Wen-Lian Hsu is a Distinguished Research Fellow in the Institute of Information Science, Academia Sinica. He received a B.S. from the Department of Mathematics, National Taiwan University in 1973 and a Ph.D. in operations research from Cornell University in 1980, respectively. He then joined Northwestern University, and was promoted to tenured associate professor in 1986. In 1989, he joined the Institute of Information Science as a research fellow.Earlier in his career, he focused on theoretical graph algorithms and frequently published papers in top-notch journals, such as JACM, SIAM Journal on Computing. After returning to Taiwan, he started research on automatic conversion of Pinyin to characters. In 1993, he invented a Chinese natural input method, which has since attracted two million users and revolutionized the phonetic input for Chinese in Taiwan. Later, he moved into question answering, and bioinformatics. He is currently the Director of the International Graduate Program in Bioinformatics in Academia Sinica.Dr. Hsu received many awards including the Distinguished Research Fellow award of the National Science Council in 1999, K. T. Li breakthrough award in 1999, IEEE Fellow in 2006, Academia Sinica Investigator Award in 2005, and Teco Technology award in 2008. From 2001 to 2002, he was the President of the Artificial Intelligence Society in Taiwan.
