 Design on Virtual Machine Based Trusted Computing Environment and Trustworthy Software
NSFC Key Project: Design on Virtual Machine Based Trusted Computing Environment and Trustworthy SoftwareGrant No. 907180407PI: Professor SUN YuzhongAbstractï¼šThis research project focuses on VM(Virtual Machine)-based trusted computing platform. The objective of designing such platform is satisfying the critical demand on the dependability and trustworthiness of computing by distributed, concurrent Internet services and applications in the world, as well as guaranteeing the ordinal, dynamic, and high scalability, the agile configuration and deployment, the transparency and universality of applications. Since the introduction of virtualization technology such as virtual machines (VMs), the designing of trusted computing platform facing huge challenges-people can reorganize, manage, and optimize computing resources with finer-grained, other than traditional HPC computing with the granularity of node. A trusted virtual computing platform must provide trusted isolation from services/Applications to VMM (virtual machine monitor), so that a trust-chain-stream traversing multiple spaces is provided. This research focuses on the virtual, trusted capability computing spaces. We present multi-dimensioned streaming trusted computing spaces model. The trustworthiness of each space in our model can be implement via trust-chain-stream, which embracing the emergence of new technology, such as multi-core, and the requirement of Internet service computing.
