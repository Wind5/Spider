When systems fail in the field, logged data are frequently the only evidence available for support engineers and developers to assess and diagnose the underlying cause. Consequently, the efficacy of such logging data is a matter of significant practical importance. We have empirically studied tens of thousands of log messages and hundreds of production failures from several widely-used systems, and built several tools for log automation and postmortem log analysis. In this talk, I will summarize our experiences on exploring questions such as “How much do log messages really help in debugging?‘’, “Are they good enough?'', “What are the opportunities for improving log qualities?'', “Can we automatically improve log messages?'', and “How can we automate the log inference?''. The insights we learnt could also benefit programmers towards better designs of their software for better failure diagnosability.
