　　In this seminar, first, recent research advances and development challenges of embeddable computing engines and mobile agent technology will be presented. Then, the design and implementation of an ISO C standard compliant embeddable C/C++ interpreter called Ch will be presented. Next, the design and implementation of a mobile agent system called Mobile-C based on this embeddable C/C++ interpreter is then introduced. Finally, applications of Ch and Mobile-C for task level control of a robot workcell with multiple manipulators, mobile robots, intelligent sensor nodes with tiny embedded computers for real-time monitoring and control, and real-time highway traffic detection and monitoring and information fusion will be highlighted.
　　Harry H. Cheng is a Professor and the Director of the Integration Engineering Laboratory at the University of California, Davis. He is a member of the Graduate Groups in Mechanical and Aeronautical Engineering, Computer Science, and Electrical and Computer Engineering. He is the Chief Architect of an embeddable C/C++ interpreter Ch for script computing, which is being widely used in both academia and industry.
