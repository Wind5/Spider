Jin Xiong received her BS degree from Sichuan University, China in 1990, MS degree from the Institute of Computing Technology (ICT), the ChineseAcademy of Sciences (CAS) in 1993, and PhD from the Graduate University of Chinese Academy of Sciences in 2006. She is currently an associate professor at ICT, CAS. She is a senior member of China Computer Federation (CCF), member of IEEE and member of ACM. Her research interests include data storage and management for data center workloads, cluster file system, high performance I/O systems.
Dr. Xiong has been focus on researches on cluster file system for high-performance computing applications for more than ten years. Supported by the Nation High-Tech Research and DevelopmentProgram of China (the “863” Program), she leaded a group to develop several cluster file systems (including DCFS, DCFS2, LionFS, DCFS3 and HVFS) for the Dawning Series of Supercomputers including Dawning-4000L, Dawning-4000A, Dawning-5000 and Dawning-6000. She is currently supported by the National Basic Research Program of China (the “973” Program) and the Natural Science Foundation of China, and leads a group to conduct researches on (1) data storage and management systems for data center workloads, (2) hybrid storage systems which consist of new types of NVMs (such as PCRAM), Flash memory, as well as DRAM and disks.
