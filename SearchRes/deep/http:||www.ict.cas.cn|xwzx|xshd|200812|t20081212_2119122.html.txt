Abstract:Interconnection of the sheer number of server nodes in a petasacle HPC system plays a vital role in the developments. InfiniBand has emerged as a compelling interconnect technology, and provides more scalability and significantly better cost performance than any other known protocols. This talk will discuss a reliability, availability, and serviceability (RAS) modeling and analysis of the Sun Datacenter Switch 3456 system, the worldâ€™s largest standards-based InfiniBand switch, with direct capacity to host up to 3,456 server nodes, against hardware faults. The talk will also discuss the system reliability improvement when practicing redundant ports and deferred repair strategies.
