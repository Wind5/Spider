ã€€ The Key Laboratory of Computer System and Architecture hosted by the ICT of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. The Laboratory was approved to be officially open both at home and abroad in 2006. It is mainly engaged in the fundamental application research in the areas related to the computer systems and architectures, with emphasis on super-parallel computer systems and multi-core processors. 
Its major research areas include: design theory of high performance computer systems; novel principles, novel structures, and novel methods of microprocessor design; novel-architecture-oriented simulation, operating systems, application modeling, and optimization technology through studying the architectures of novel high-performance computers; micro-architectures of high-end processors; virtualization technology of cross-platform multi-systems, design method of multi-core parallel processors on large-scale slice, design method of extendable and reconfigurable processors; models, languages, and compiling of parallel program design; code generation and optimization of advanced microprocessors; reliability design of computer architectures and micro architectures; self-test, self-diagnosis, and self-healing design of multi-core processors; VLSI test and design verification methods; and other innovation methods and key technologies constantly provided for the development of the high-performance computer system and high-performance processor design area. 
In 2009, the Key Laboratory of Computer System and Architecture had become an innovative research group of the National Natural Science Foundation of China.
