Abstract:FastScan and TestKompress support all standard fault models such as stuck-at, transition, IDDQ, bridge, and path delay. These fault models are typically sufficient to create a highly efficient pattern set that detects the majority of potential defects. However, a number of defects are not covered by these models and are detected only by accident. These defects require specific conditions that cannot be defined for the existing fault models.
You can now use the user-defined fault model (UDFM) feature to define custom fault models. These custom models enable you to generate specific test patterns for process-related defects like intra-cell bridges or any other kind of defect that requires additional constraints.
