ServerSwitch: A Programmable and High Performance Platform for Data Center Networks----中国科学院计算技术研究所
As one of the fundamental infrastructures for cloud computing, data center networks (DCN) have recently been studied extensively. We currently use pure software-based systems, FPGA based platforms, e.g., NetFPGA, or OpenFlow switches, to implement and evaluate various DCN designs including topology design, control plane and routing, and congestion control. However, software-based approaches suffer from high CPU overhead and processing latency; FPGA based platforms are difficult to program and incur high cost; and OpenFlow focuses on control plane functions at present. We design a ServerSwitch to address the above problems. ServerSwitch is motivated by the observation that commodity Ethernet switching chips are becoming programmable and that the PCI-E interface provides high throughput and low latency between the server CPU and I/O subsystem. ServerSwitch uses a commodity switching chip for various customized packet forwarding, and leverages the server CPU for control and data plane packet processing, due to the low latency and high throughput between the switching chip and server CPU. 
Dr. Guohan Lu received Ph.D degree from the Electronic Engineering department of Tsinghua University in 2008. He is now an associate researcher in Microsoft Research Asia. Previously, he focused on Internet measurements, fault diagnosis and inference from measurements, especially TCP. Within Microsoft Research, he mainly works on Data center networking. He has published several papers on top networking conferences such as IMC, INFOCOM, SIGCOMM and he won Best paper award on USENIX NSDI 2011.
