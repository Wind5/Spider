Dongrui Fan received Ph.D. degree of computer architecture in 2005 from Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, and now he is an Associate Professor of the institute since 2006. His research interests focus on computer architecture, on-chip multi-core/many-core architecture, and low-power embedded micro-architecture design. Currently, he leads Advanced Micro-System research group (AMS, about 70 members) designing high-throughput computing system. He also contributes a lot for processor-related research in China.
Dongrui Fan is a senior member of China Computer Federation (CCF), member of Technical Committee Member of Computer Architecture and System Software of CCF and IEEE member. He serves as an editor of Sustainable Computing Journal, as an Information Officer in IEEE Computer Society Special Technical Community on Sustainable Computing, and Technical Co-chair of IGCC2013. He also serves as a Program Committee Member of HPCA 2013, ASP-DAC 2012, PDCAT in 2009 and 2010, and as the Program Vice-Chair in the 40th International Conference on Parallel Processing (ICPP) in 2011, and several workshops. He is also a HiPEAC member in Europe. HiPEAC is an excellent European network of Excellence on computer architecture area.
