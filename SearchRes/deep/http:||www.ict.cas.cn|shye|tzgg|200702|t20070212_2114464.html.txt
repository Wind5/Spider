  The 16th Asian Test Symposium(ATS) will be held at October 9-11, 2007, in Beijing Friendship Hotel, Beijing, P.R.China. The ATS provides an international forum for engineers and researchersfrom all countries of the World, especially from Asia, to present and discuss variousaspects of system, board and device testing with design, manufacturing and fieldconsiderations in mind.
  The 8th IEEE Workshop on RTL and High Level Testing(WRTLT) will be held at October 12-13, 2007, in Beijing Friendship Hotel, Beijing, P.R.China.The purpose of this workshop is to bring researchers and practitioners on LSI testing from all over the world together to exchange ideas and experiences on register transfer level (RTL) and high level testing.  WRTLT07, the eighth workshop, will be held in conjunction with the 16th Asian Test Symposium (ATS07) in Beijing, China. We hope and expect this workshop provides an ideal forum for frank discussion on this important topic for the future system-on-a-chip (SoC) devices.
