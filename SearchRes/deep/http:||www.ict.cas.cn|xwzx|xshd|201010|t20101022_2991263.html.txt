 报告题目：Designing High Performance, Scalable and Fault-Resilient MPI Library for Modern Clusters 
This presentation will start with an overview of the emerging networking technologies and protocols (InfiniBand, Ethernet/iWARP and RDMA over Converged Enhanced Ethernet) for designing modern clusters. An overview of high performance, scalable and fault-tolerant/resilient MPI library while exploiting these emerging networking technologies/protocols and their features will be presented. Advanced designs and features of the MVAPICH/MVAPICH2 library including scalable inter-node communication with different transport protocols, kernel-based zero-copy intra-node communication, one-sided communication, multi-core-aware hierarchical collectives, etc. will be presented. Applications-level studies using MVAPICH/MVAPICH2 library will be highlighted. Finally, we will critically examine some of the needs of designing MPI libraries for next generation exascale systems.
