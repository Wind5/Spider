Abstract: In this talk, we consider a wireless sensor network that consists of a large number of sensors and a limited number of mobile data collectors. In such a network, mobile collectors take over the burden of routing from sensors, roaming over the sensing area and collecting data from nearby sensors via short-range wireless communications. We present a series of efficient mobile data gathering schemes in such sensor networks, which aim to prolong network lifetime and shorten data gathering latency.1、Moving path planning with multi-hop relays.2、Single-hop data gathering.3、Mobile data gathering with controlled mobility and SDMA technique.4、Bounded relay hop mobile data gathering scheme.
