Abstract: Conventionally, FPGA devices are used as either glue logic or data interface. However, the full potential of FPGA is much more beyond these conventional applications. In this presentation, several topics, loosely categorized into “unconventional” applications are discussed. The examples are extracted from real high energy physics applications including waveform digitization, data compression, filtering and reconfigurable computing in FPGA. The presentation is designed for general physicist/engineer audience. 
Bio: Dr. Jinyuan Wu received his BS degree in Space Physics from Department of Geophysics, Peking University, Beijing, China in 1982, MS degree in Micro-Electro-Ultrasonic Devices from Institute of Acoustics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China in 1986 and Ph. D. in Experimental High Energy Physics from Department of Physics, The Pennsylvania State University in 1992. He serves as an Electronics Engineer II and III in Particle Physics Division, Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory since 1997. He has lectured a refresher course Digital Design with FPGAs: Examples and Resource Saving Tips in IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium and Medical Imaging Conference (NSS/MIC) in 2007.
