Many Important applications,such as compiler optimization, bug checking, and parallelization, require precise pointer analysis to be effective. In this talk, I will introduce a new method thatformalizes pointer analysis as a valueflow problem. I will highlightthe key challenges in pointeranalysis (e.g., flow-sensitivity and context sensitivity)Anddemonstrate how these challenges are effectively addressed in ouranalysis. With the value flow formalization and a suite of optimization techniques,we are able to achievean order of magnitude speed up than the state-of-the-art.主讲人介绍 Dr. Lian Li is a principal member of technical staff in Oracle Labs, Brisbane,Australia.He joined SUN in 2008,after getting his PhD from University of New South Wales, Australia. In Oracle, he was mainly working on program analyses for bug checking and has developed various program analysis techniques. His research interests focus in the area of program language implementation, including program analysis, parallel computing, compiler optimization, software testing and debugging.
