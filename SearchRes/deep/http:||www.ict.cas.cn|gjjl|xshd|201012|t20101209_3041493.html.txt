摘要： Performance modelling for scientific applications is an important task for assessing potential performance bottlenecks and assist in hardware procurement for HPC systems. Recent progress on communication tracing provides novel opportunities for communication modelling. We contribute a fundamentally novel approach. By extrapolating communication traces and execution time of a parallel application, a set of traces for smaller number of nodes provides the base to synthetically generate a trace for larger number of nodes. The extrapolated larger trace can subsequently be replayed to empirically detect scalability problems or analyzed to detect communication patterns or determine constraints on scalability, which is without precedence.
