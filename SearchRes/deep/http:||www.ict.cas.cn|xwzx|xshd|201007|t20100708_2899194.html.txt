摘要： In this talk, Dr. Hwang will address recent advances in machine virtualization and elastic resources that change HPC (high-performance Computing) and HTC (high-throughput Computing) from static computing grids (网格) to Internet clouds (云计算) and Internet of Things (物联网). He will address the datacenter design, virtualized infrastructure, platform security, trust management, and data integrity issues for harnessing a virtualized cloud platform over distributed datacenters. He will assess the role of virtualization technology in protecting cloud resources and datasets in infrastructure (IaaS), platform (PaaS), and application (SaaS) services in the clouds. The interaction with SOA (service oriented architecture) and the support of Internet of Things by cloud technology are also discussed towards the building of a “smart earth”（智慧地球）on which we live.
