 报告题目：What’s Special about Mobile Recommender Systems? 时间：2012年4月27日（周五）上午9：30 地点：计算所四层报告厅 报告人：熊辉, Rutgers, the State University of New Jersey 摘要： Recommender systems aim to identify content of interest from overloaded information by exploiting the opinions of a community of users. Developing personalized recommender systems in mobile and pervasive environments is more challenging than developing recommender systems from traditional domains due to the complexity of spatial data, the unclear roles of context-aware information, and the increasing availability of environment-sensing capabilities. In this talk, we introduce the unique features that distinguish pervasive personalized recommendation systems from classic recommendation systems. An examination of major research needs in pervasive personalized recommendation research reveals some new opportunities for personalized recommendation in mobile and pervasive applications. 报告人简介： Dr. Hui Xiong is an Associate Professor and the Vice Chair of the Management Science and Information Systems Department at the Rutgers, the State University of New Jersey, where he received a two-year early promotion/tenure (2009), the Rutgers University Board of Trustees Research Fellowship for Scholarly Excellence (2009), and the ICDM-2011 Best Research Paper Award.
