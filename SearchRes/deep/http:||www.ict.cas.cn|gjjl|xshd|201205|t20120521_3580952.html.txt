A High-performance, Low-power Cache Design, and Enabling Speech Recognition on Smartphones----中国科学院计算技术研究所
 A High-performance, Low-power Cache Design, and Enabling Speech Recognition on Smartphones
摘要This talk consists of two parts, one on processor cache design and the other on SoC applications. In the first half of the talk, I will talk about a high-performance L1 cache design that exploits software semantics for the purpose of saving power. In the second half, I will discuss how we optimized one of the best-known speech recognition engines for the purpose of enabling on smartphone-class devices.
