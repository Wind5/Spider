 In Search of Design Inspiration: A Semantic-based Retrieval in Support of Concept Design
Abstract:Sources of inspiration help designers to define the context of their designs and reflect on the emotional impact of their new products. By observing and interpreting sources of inspiration, designers form vocabularies of terms, pallets of colours, or mood boards with images, which express their feelings, inspire their creativity and help them communicate design concepts. The talk focuses on the use of semantic technology for developing computational tools in support of designersâ€™ creativity. In particular, it will highlight the importance of providing designers with a degree of diversity, ambiguity and uncertainty in the information gathering and idea generation process.
