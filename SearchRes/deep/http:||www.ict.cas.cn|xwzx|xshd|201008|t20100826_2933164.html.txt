 Hey, why should I forward any packets to you? or how to integrate selfishness in future Internet.
摘要：　The past years have seen the emergence of new scenarios in networks: sensor nets, DTNs, social networks, etc. All these interesting and challenging cases have in common that the traditional forwarding paradigm, that is "store and forward," is not really applicable. We will present in this talk a framework englobing all different forwarding paradigm in the above networks as well as classical networks. In particular, the framework integrates selfish nodes and provides a way to deal with incentives to cooperate in information diffusion in a network. It provides therefore an interesting framework to analyze future Internet. The new framework open new way for innovative approach in information diffusion in networks and in particular in distributed anomaly detection.
