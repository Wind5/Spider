My team is currently exploring new ways to build the next-generation data center servers. We are looking for opportunities across the entire hardware and software stack, including ISAs, chip/memory/storage/network architectures, system software, run-time environment, data center management systems, etc.2. 09.2003  08.2010: Research Staff Member, IBM Austin Research Lab.PERCS (Productive, Easy to use, Reliable Computer Systems). The goal of PERCS is to deliver a multi-petaflop high performance computer. As a key member of the architecture/performance team, I led or co-led the design and evaluation of various CMP cache memory hierarchies, including advanced cache coherence protocols, intra-chip cache communication topology, near memory processing, high performance memory hubs, memory in processor, and advanced data prefetching mechanisms. I also led the development of the PERCS simulator and developed its cycle accurate processor and nest models. I am a lead performance architect of the 10 Petaflops machine Blue Waters, initially scheduled to come out in 2011, but later cancelled by IBM.Power7, I led the development of a cycle-accurate model in a full-system simulation environment for the Power7 microprocessor. The model was about two orders of magnitude faster than IBMˇs existing simulator used by the product team at that time with comparable accuracy. I, working with the Chief Architects and other members in the research team and the development team, used this model to (i) to refine designs of various units in Power7, (ii) to push research ideas into the Power7, and (iii) to perform competitive analysis.TRIPS (Tera-op, Reliable, Intelligently adaptive Processing System). I studied various NUCA (non-uniform cache architecture) organizations for flexible CMP cache sharing mechanisms.STI (a.k.a., Cell). I developed cycle-accurate simulator models for the on-chip interconnect bus, cache coherence engine, and memory system of the Cell architecture. I also provided consulting services to its simulator development team.ACAS (IBM Austin Center for Advanced Studies). I was the Lead Research Advisor in the system & software area. I was responsible for reviewing/ranking proposals for IBM faculty awards and PhD fellowship awards and helping organize semi-annual CAS conferences.3. 01.2002  08.2003: Postdoctoral Research Associate, University of Utah. I was a university partner of SGIˇs Ultraviolet project, whose goal was to design, evaluate, and produce peta-scale systems.I led the design of Active Memory Systems, which exploited the potential and feasibility of incorporating processing power into the memory controllers.I led the development of the simulator infrastructure used by the entire Ultraviolet team, which included researchers at SGI, MIT, George Washington University, and University of Utah.I led the design of scalable coherence mechanisms and scalable synchronization mechanisms for large-scale CC NUMA systems.I acted as the technical leader for a team of three graduate students and one undergraduate student.4. 07.1999  12.2001: Research Associate, University of Utah As a full-time staff member of the Impulse Adaptable Memory Systems project, I played a leading role in the design/evaluation phase and a key role at the development phase. Overall, I had been a major contributor tothe architecture-level design,simulator development,kernel extension,application analyses and performance evaluation, andchip-level functional verification of the ASIC design.5. 07.1996  07.1999: Research Assistant, University of UtahThis was for my dissertation work. The key idea was to use an intelligent memory system to significantly increase the performance of the processor caches and the system bus by allowing applications to control how data should be present to the caches during runtime. For instance, multiple sparsely store data items in the memory may be merged a dense line in a cache.04.1996  12.1996: Research Assistant for project Avalanche Scalable Parallel Processor, University of Utah Avalanche entailed the design and construction of a usable and scalable parallel computing platform that was not exorbitantly expensive, yet still capable of achieving high performance. My work was to design, simulate, and evaluate an assist cache and a hardware-directed cache prefetching mechanism.01.1996  04.1996: Research Assistant for project Module Manipulation, University of Utah Worked as a programmer for this project, which added modularity to existing languages by providing a suite of operators that accept modules as arguments and produce modules as results.09.1995  12.1995: Teaching Assistant for class Digital System Design, University of Utah Grader and lab tutor for this undergraduate-level class about the fundamental concepts of digital system theory and design.07.1994  07.1995: Software engineer, Kingstar Computer Co., P.R.China Project manager and main developer of a four-member team to build a LAN-based system that tracesmanufacturing information in real time and generates instant feedbacks.09.1991  07.1994: Research Assistant for project ¨Remote Procedure Call〃, Fudan University Primary programmer of a project to implement the remote procedure call paradigm in a special environment.09.1991  07.1993: Research Assistant for project ¨OSI High Level Protocol Implementation Based On TCP/UDP/IP〃, Fudan University Principal designer and programmer of an effort to implement the transport layer of the ISO/OSI model based on the TCP/UDP/IP implementation.PUBLICATIONSJournal PapersPERCS System Architecture.E.
