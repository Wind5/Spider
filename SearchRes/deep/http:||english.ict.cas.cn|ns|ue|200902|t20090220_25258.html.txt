Abstract:Within the Collaborative Research Center 476 IMPROVE and the Transfer Center 61, both funded by German Research Foundation DFG. ( see www-i3.informatik.rwth-aachen.de-research), we have studied novel tool support to keep the results of different developers consistent to each other. Both projects were carried out between groups of Engineering and Computer Science at RWTH Aachen University.Consistency or traceability is a current topic, especially in connection to model-driven development. We are studying interactive and incremental tools for consistency, called integrators, since many years. Tools are systematically derived using a meta tool environment, being based on graph specifications. Rules for consistency management can be postulated before the tool construction process but also by the user during tool application. Our findings are being used in industry.In the first part of the talk we report about our activities in the Software Engineering group. In the second part, we give an overview of the CRC and the TC activities. In the third part, we discuss our findings on integrator tool construction and maintenance.
