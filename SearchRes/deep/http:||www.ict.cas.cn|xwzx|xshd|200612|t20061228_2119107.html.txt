 报告摘要：  Numerically optimising a cost function on a manifold has many applications in signal processing and wireless communications.  The traditional approach to developing a numerical algorithm for minimizing a cost function on a manifold is to endow the manifold with a metric structure and then use judiciously parallel transport and the Riemannian exponential map to generalise Euclidean algorithms (such as the conjugate gradient or the Newton method) to the manifold setting. This talk will present a more general framework and explain the theoretical and practical advantages of working in this greater generality. Specifically, this framework enables an arbitrary algorithm in Euclidean space to be transported to a manifold, and is sufficiently flexible to allow the domains of attraction, the computational complexity and the convergence rate to be altered significantly, while at the same time guaranteeing the local convergence of the transported algorithm to be the same or faster than the original algorithm.  The challenge of extending this framework to stochastic filtering on manifolds will be touched on informally.
