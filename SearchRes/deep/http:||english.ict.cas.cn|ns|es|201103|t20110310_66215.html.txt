The project “High Performance Multi-Core CPU Design and Prototype System Implementation”, undertaken by the Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences (ICT, CAS), passed acceptance checks by expert groups organized by the CAS Bureau of High-Tech Research and Development on March 3, 2011.
As the prelude to research project on Godson-3 processor, the project aims at obtaining key technologies of chip multi-core processor design. It has reached its goal after years of hard work by ICT’s researchers. For example, they have designed various architectures for Godson-3 processor and multi-core processor, including I/O-centric processor architecture and scalable multi-core architecture based which adopts the on-chip interconnect of Mesh and Crossbar. Their research results have been published in famous international journals such as ISCA, HPCA, IEEE and Micro.
Given its remarkable achievements, the experts groups agreed that the project passed the acceptance checks.
