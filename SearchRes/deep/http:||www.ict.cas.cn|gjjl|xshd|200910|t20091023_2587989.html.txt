User context is expected to be important on the mobile Internet, with user location being a prominent aspect of the context. We are also witnessing a movement towards cloud computing and outsourcing of data management functionality. 　 　The talk covers a query-location privacy solution that offers location privacy at low cost and enables trade-offs that involve the amount of privacy, the query cost, and the query accuracy. If time permits, the talk will also cover briefly a solution to the problem of outsourcing the management of private spatial data. The challenge is how to ensure that the data is private and thus "hidden" from the service provider while also supporting the efficient querying of the data.
