Abstract: Data center and cloud computing have become extremely popular, both for industry and the academia. However, there are many challenges for configuring, diagnosing, and securing the data center networks and systems. In this talk, we will first briefly introduce the following work developed in the Northwestern Lab of Internet and Security Technology (LIST) (http://list.cs.northwestern.edu) that aim to address these problems. 1) Generic and automatic address configuration for data center networks (DAC), 2) Scalable monitoring and diagnosis of multi-tier cloud services (Rake); and 3) High-speed and accurate intrusion prevention of sophisticated attacks (NetShield and WebShield). Then we will focus on some of the work, e.g., Rake, for more detailed discussion.
