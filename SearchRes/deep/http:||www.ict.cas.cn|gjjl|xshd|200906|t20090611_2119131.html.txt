报告摘要： It has been widely recognized that local phase provides important information in characterizing image structures. The measurement of local phase has also been shown to have strong perceptual relevance and implications. However, the use of local phase information in image analysis and processing has not been fully exploited. This talk focuses on some of our recent work on using local phase information for a number of image analysis and processing applications. In particular, we will introduce a complex wavelet transform domain local phase coherence theory and its applications in image registration and fusion. We will also discuss the use of wavelet phase in image similarity measures, which have good potentials in solving many pattern recognition problems.
