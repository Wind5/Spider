Speaker:Prof. Shuo-Yen Robert Li, IEEE Fellow, The Chinese University of HongKongTime: 10:00am, 2009.7.3Place: Room 440, Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of SciencesAbstract:This is an expository talk on the theory of (linear) network coding with a wide variety of applications to multicast, peer-to-peer communications, wireless networks, sensor networks, personal communications, etc. Network coding is a paradigm shift in the mode of data transport from the traditional store-and-forward. The Network Coding Theorem guarantees the best possible throughput. Linearity makes the hardware/software implementation feasibly fast for practical applications. The wide applicability of network coding has generated interest in multi-disciplinary research among computer science, information/coding theory, matrix theory, networking, operations research, and switching. The closing part of the talk extends linear network coding to convolutional coding.
