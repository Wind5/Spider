Mr. Mike Moore, director of Server Alliance in Advanced Micro Devices, gave a speech on server computing at 10:00 AM on April 20, 2012 in meeting room 446 of the ICT building. This talk was invited and chaired by Mr. Rui Hou, State Key Laboratory of Computer.Firstly, a look back of server development was presented. Mike pointed out that the goal of server development nowadays is power efficiency. The three possible futures of server computing are scale-out computing, cloud computing and heterogeneous computing. Secondly, the AMD solution of heterogeneous computing APU was introduced. Combined of AMD CPU, AMD GPU and third party IP components, APU not only provide high power efficiency but also make heterogeneous programming easier. Finally attendees had a lively discussion on the issues above.
