A High-performance, Low-power Cache Design, and Enabling Speech Recognition on Smartphones
 A High-performance, Low-power Cache Design, and Enabling Speech Recognition on Smartphones
Time： 10:30-12:00 am , May. 28,2012 (January)Place：Room 446, ICT. CASSpeaker:  Dr. Zhen Fang 
AbstractThis talk consists of two parts, one on processor cache design and the other on SoC applications. In the first half of the talk, I will talk about a high-performance L1 cache design that exploits software semantics for the purpose of saving power. In the second half, I will discuss how we optimized one of the best-known speech recognition engines for the purpose of enabling on smartphone-class devices.
