报告时间：星期二（7月16日）10：30－12：00。地点：221会议室Abstract:Technology constraints increasingly allow heterogeneous processors, that combine multiple types of compute cores sharing memory, and hybrid systems, where different types of processors are combined at a system level, to gain a market advantage in spite of the challenges associated with programming such systems. This talk will briefly review the experience gained with the Cell Broadband Engine processor, including some of its applications in high-performance computing and embedded systems. Next the role of heterogeneity in commercial systems is discussed, and a hardware and software approach is discussed that allows for the integration of reconfigurable accelerators in high-performance and commercial systems. We discuss how these technologies can help us store and analyze the vast amounts of digital data of various types that are collected and the new levels of insight, foresight, and optimization that can be achieved.Bio:H. Peter Hofstee currently works at the IBM Austin Research Laboratory on workload-optimized and hybrid systems. Peter has degrees in theoretical physics (MS, Rijks Universiteit Groningen, Netherlands) and computer science (PhD, California Inst. of Technology). At IBM Peter has worked on microprocessors, including the first CMOS processor to demonstrate GHz operation (1997), and he was the chief architect of the synergistic processor elements in the Cell Broadband Engine, known from its use in the Sony Playstation 3 and the Roadrunner supercomputer that first broke the 1 Petaflop Linpack benchmark. His interests include VLSI, multicore and heterogeneous microprocessor architecture, security, system design and programming. Peter has over 100 patents issued or pending.
