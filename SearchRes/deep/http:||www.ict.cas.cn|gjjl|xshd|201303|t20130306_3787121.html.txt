The gem5 simulation infrastructure, which is the merger of M5 and GEMS, represents the combined efforts of multiple academic and industrial institutions mostly from the United States and Europe. Over the past decade, M5 and GEMS have been used thousands of publications and have been downloaded tens of thousands of times. The high level of collaboration on the gem5 project, combined with the previous success of the component parts and a liberal BSD-like license, make it an influential full-system simulation tool in the years to come. In this talk I want to encourage more Chinese development and contributions by presenting a general overview of gem5’s capabilities. At the end of my talk, I will also briefly review the usage of gem5 within AMD Research.
