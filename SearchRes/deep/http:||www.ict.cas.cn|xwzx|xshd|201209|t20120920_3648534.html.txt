In 2002, the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency called for the creation of commercially viable computing systems that would be both highly productive and high performing. IBM's response to this challenge was named the Productive Easy-to-use Reliable Computing System (PERCS) and is commercially offered as the P775 high-performance computing system. PERCS achieves significantly higher efficiencies when compared to other state-of-the-art high-performance computing systems, especially on workloads that involve communication. It does so through tight integration of compute, interconnect, storage, and software elements. This talk will describe the PERCS architecture, some of the design decisions that went into its creation, and illustrate system characteristics that can be exploited for high performance and productivity.
Ram Rajamony is a Research Staff Member at IBM Research in Austin TX. He received a B.Tech degree in Electrical Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology Madras in 1989, and a Ph.D. degree from Rice University in 1998. Ram is the primary lead for performance on the DARPA-sponsored PERCS project and has had a significant role in its design, implementation, testand benchmarking. He has received multiple awards from IBM for his work on high-performance computing and has authored or coauthored more than 25 patents and 25 technical papers. He was also designated an IBM Master Inventor in 2008 and is a member of the Association for Computing Machinery.
