报告摘要：This seminar explores solutions to the problems associated with chips  that contain from 100s (current technology) to 100s of thousands of  processors (10 to 15 years time). It will give an introduction to the  use of explicit concurrency in ISAs using an approach based on code  fragmentation and called microthreading. It will consider microthreaded architectures, and their scalability, including the  overhead of the support logic. It will be shown that 100s of  processors could be integrated in todays technology and that this figure can be scaled with Moores law to the end of silicon. moreover this can be achieved with backward compatibility using extensions to existing ISAs. The seminar will also look at both performance and  power scalability issues and show that the dynamic allocation of processors to contexts can provide a mechanism for distributed  operating systems for on-chip microgrids, which can manage resources to optimise power, throughput or performance, using only compiled  code and dynamic control of the binary codes schedules.
