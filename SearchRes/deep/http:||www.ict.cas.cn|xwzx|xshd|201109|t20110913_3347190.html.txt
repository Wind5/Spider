Title： 1. Workload-Optimized Systems Trends and Research Directions 　  2. IBM Compiler and Tooling Technology Advancements in High- Productivity and High Performance Computing 
Speaker：1.Bob Blainey, IBM Fellow 　  2.Yaoqing Gao, IBM Toronto, Researcher Abstract： 1. Systems technology is in a period of unusually dramatic and rapid change. Processor technology has evolved to exploit multi-core but is likely to need to adapt once again as technology limits are reached. Memory is critical to the performance of most workloads and is increasingly becoming the most expensive and power-hungry component of high end systems. Storage continues to be critical to manage exploding volumes of data but is also being transformed by cheap, non-volatile memory technology such as flash. Finally, networks are evolving not only in delivered bandwidth and end-to-end latency but in their inherent reliability and in the intelligence that can be applied in end-point adapters and switches. In this talk, I will provide some perspective on these changes and their impacts on data center architecture, especially in the context of industry trends such as cloud computing and big data analytics. I will also provide a glimpse into the diverse collection of IBM research projects in computer architecture and in supporting software. 2. HPC systems will continue to grow larger and be more complex. Software to be executed on these systems will benefit from advanced compilation and tooling technology. This presentation discusses major technical challenges in high-performance computing and how IBM compiler and tooling technology addresses productivity, performance and scalability.
