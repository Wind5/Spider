摘要：We study a number of natural language decipherment problems using unsupervised methods. These problems include letter substitution ciphers, character code conversion, archaeological phonetic decipherment, and word-based ciphers.  We aim at training statistical machine translation systems without parallel data, in which text in one language is viewed as a code for text in another language. In addition, we study Shannons formulas concerning how much intercepted data is required to solve a given type of cipher. 报告人简历：Dr. Kevin Knight is a Senior Research Scientist and Fellow at the Information Sciences Institute of the University of Southern California.
