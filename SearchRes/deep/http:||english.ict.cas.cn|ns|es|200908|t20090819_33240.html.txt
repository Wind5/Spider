The 35th ISCA 2008 was organized by the Institute on June 21-25, 2008.  As the most famous and highest level international academic exchange conference in the area of system architecture, as well as one of the highest level international conferences in the area of computer research, ISCA was held for the first time in China since its first session in 1973. 259 theses were contributed, 37 of which were accepted. The 5-day conference attracted a registered attendance of over 560 Chinese and foreign experts and scholars in computer science and personnel from the industrial circles, 200 of whom were Chinese scholars. The successful organization of ISCA 2008 in Beijing provided a valuable chance for more domestic insiders to participate in international exchange, and also helped to expand the reputation and influential power of our institute in the international computer domain.
