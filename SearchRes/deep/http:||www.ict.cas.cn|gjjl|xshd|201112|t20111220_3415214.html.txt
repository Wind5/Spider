 Speaker: Dr. Ke Yi,Hong Kong University of Science and Technology 
Abstract: Facing today's big data challenge, it is often impossible and unnecessary to examine the entire data set for many analytical tasks. What is more useful is various concise statistical summaries extracted from the underlying data that capture certain data characteristics. In this talk, I will present simple and efficient algorithms for computing some classical statistical summaries over distributed data, in particular the frequency estimation problem and quantiles. These algorithms can be easily implemented in distributed systems like MapReduce, Dremel, and sensor networks. The talk is based on the joint work with Zengfeng Huang, Lu Wang, Yunhao Liu, and Guihai Chen, previously presented at INFOCOM'11 and SIGMOD'11. 
Bio: Ke Yi received his B.E. from Tsinghua University and Ph.D. from Duke University, in 2001 and 2006 respectively, both in computer science. After spending one year at AT&T Labs as a researcher, he has been an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology since 2007. His research interests include algorithms, data structures, and databases. Center for Advanced Computing Research, ICT December, 2011
