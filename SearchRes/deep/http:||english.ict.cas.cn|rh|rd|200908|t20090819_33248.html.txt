Based on the needs of national strategy and the development of wireless communications industry, Wireless Communications Technology Research Center (WCTRC) is devoting itself to the research and development of smart and green wireless communications system's core technology and key equipment. WCTRC focuses on the research and technology promotion of some advanced high-tech fields, including the areas of low power wireless communications baseband chips, cooperative wireless communications and software radio technology, high speed broadband mobile communications technology, complex and heterogeneous mobile communications network control, wireless resource management, the new generation low power wireless network system architecture and so on.
After years of effort, the Center has accomplished a lot of achievements on the key technology of mobile communications and its core software and hardware. The independent development of LTE baseband processor chips has accomplished initial results. Independent DSP core and the wireless communications protocol stacks are making good progress. The Center has submitted a series of draft resolutions and proposals to the standardization organization. In recent years, the WCTRC has undertaken many major projects, including the national broadband wireless projects, the Chinese Academy of Sciences major projects, the National Development and Reform Commission CNGI projects, Beijing Science and Technology Plan project and so on. By the efforts of all its staff, the WCTRC will certainly make a greater contribution to the development of the Nation's mobile communications industry in the future.
