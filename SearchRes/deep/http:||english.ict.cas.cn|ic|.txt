  Founded in 1956, the Institute of Computing Technology (ICT) of Chinese Academy of Sciences is the first academic institute specialized in comprehensive research on computer science and technology and also the cradle of Chinese computer industry. ICT has always attached great importance to the academic exchange and cooperation with international science and technology communities and has established channels for scientific and technological cooperation and exchange with many well-known universities, institutions and hi-tech enterprises in the world. ICT sends over 150 persons abroad every year, and has hosted many important international conferences including ISCA08 and ICDCS08. The team of excellent overseas scholars plays a key role in ICT's research, and has a significant influence on China's computer graduate education through the “Dragon-Star Program”, in which graduate courses are given in China by overseas Chinese professors. Close cooperation with enterprises such as AMD and ST-Micro has sped up progress in research projects such as Dawning and Godson, and helps ICT upgrade the level of its results.
