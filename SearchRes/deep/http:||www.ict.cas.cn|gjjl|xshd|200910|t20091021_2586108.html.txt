　　报告简介：We design a simple position-specific hidden Markov model to predict protein structure. Our new framework naturally repeats itself to converge to a final target, conglomerating fragment assembly, clustering, target selection, refinement, and consensus, all in one process. Our initial implementation of this theory converges to within 6\AA~of the native structures for 100\% decoys on all 6 standard benchmark proteins used in ROSETTA~\citep{Sim97} which achieved only 14\% to 94\% for the same data. The qualities of the best decoys and the final decoys our theory converges to are also notably better.
