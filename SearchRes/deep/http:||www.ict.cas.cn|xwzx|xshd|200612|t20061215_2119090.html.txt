 摘 要：In this talk, I will give an overview of the recent progress on evaluation of summarization. Specifically, I will use Document Understand Conference (DUC), an annual large scale summarization evaluation meeting sponsored by NIST, USA, as an example to illustrate how automatic evaluation methods could be used to assist fast turn-around evaluation of summarization. I will discuss a few methods including SEE, ROUGE, Pyramid, BE, and a new information-theoretic approach.
简 历：Before joining Microsoft at the end of February 2006, Dr. Chin-Yew Lin was a senior research scientist at the Information Sciences Institute of University of Southern California (USC/ISI) where he worked in the Natural Language Processing and Machine Translation group since 1997. He is currently a Lead Researcher and Research Manager at Microsoft Research Asia (MSRA). At MSRA, he leads the WISE (Web Information Summarization and Enrichment) platform project aiming to deliver concise and value-added information to web users in more effective, efficient, and enjoyable ways. His research interests are automated summarization, opinion analysis, question answering (QA), information extraction, machine translation (MT), and machine learning. Recently, he has been developing automatic evaluation technologies forsummarization, QA, and MT. He created the ROUGE automatic summarization evaluation package. It has become the de facto standard in summarization evaluations.
　　　  林钦佑博士在2006年2月加盟微软之前，曾于1997年起在南加州大学信息科学研究所(USC/ISI) 的自然语言处理与机器翻译组担任高级研究员。现任微软亚洲研究院 (MSRA) Lead Researcher 及 Research Manager。他在MSRA领导万维网信息摘要及加值计划 (WISE) ，希望将简明及加值的信息以更有效力、更有效率及更有趣的方式传递给万维网使用者。他的研究方向包括：自动摘要抽取，用户评价分析，问答系统，信息提取，机器翻译及机器学习。他长期致力于摘要抽取、问答系统及机器学习的自动评价技术。在南加州大学任职期间，他研究并开发了“ROUGE”信息摘要自动评测系统，该系统现已成为摘要抽取评测技术的通用标准。
