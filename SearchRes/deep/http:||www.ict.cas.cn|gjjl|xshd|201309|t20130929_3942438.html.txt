Recent announcementsby commercial effort Dwave of a 128-quantum-bit adiabatic system,although controversial in terms of its quantum properties, illustratethe engineering progress that has been made.In this talk, I will present a basic quantum computing architecture basedupon trapped-ion technology. I will examine several challenges to scalingthis architecture and explore adaptations of traditional computer systemssolutions towards these challenges. Specifically, I will introduce aninterconnection network that uses quantum teleportation to addressreliability and latency challenges in long-distance communication.I will present a quantum memory hierarchy to decrease the area andperformance penalties resulting from quantum error correction.Finally, I will discuss work that explores static and dynamic compilationstrategies for generating quantum machine code which approximatearbitrary quantum rotations, an important primitive in many quantumalgorithms. 主讲人简介 Fred Chong is the Director of Computer Engineering and a Professor ofComputer Science at UCSB.
