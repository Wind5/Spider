Abstract: In this talk, I will summarize our recent findings about rules that may play important roles in determining the genomic structures and gene arrangements in a bacterial genoms, as well as practical applications of such theoretical studies. 
Bio: Ying Xu is the Regents and Georgia Research Alliance Eminent Scholar Chair and Professor of bioinformatics and computational biology in the Biochemistry and Molecular Biology Department, and the Director of the Institute of Bioinformatics, University of Georgia (UGA). Before joining UGA in Sept 2003, he was a senior staff scientist and group leader at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL). He also holds a ChangJiang Chair Professor position at Jilin University in China and guest professorship at Peking University, and Zhejiang University of China, and National Central University and National Cheng-Kung University of Taiwan. Ying Xu received his Ph.D. degree in theoretical computer science from the University of Colorado at Boulder in 1991. Between 1991 and 1993, he was a visiting assistant professor at Colorado School of Mines. Ying Xu started his bioinformatics career in 1993 when he joined ORNL to take part in the Human Genome Project. His current research interests include (a) computational inference and modeling of biological pathways and networks, particularly for microbial organisms, (b) cancer bioinformatics, (c) comparative genome analyses, and (d) protein structure prediction and modeling. He has over 200 publications, including four books. He has also given over 150 invited/contributed talks at conferences, research organizations, and universities.
