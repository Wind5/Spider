With increasing network and community-based events and applications, such as group-based crime, pool manipulation and social network interactions, behavior couplings contribute to the causes and effects of eventual business problems. Effective approaches for analyzing coupled behaviors are not available, since existing methods mainly focus on individual behavior analysis; mixed attributes, coupling relationships and behavior interactions are often overlooked or not supported. This talk first defines the problem of coupled behavior analysis (CBA problem). A Coupled Hidden Markov Model (CHMM)-based approach is then illustrated to model and detect abnormal group-based trading behaviors and dynamics. Finally, we discuss the prospects of CBA study. 报告人简介： Longbing Cao is a professor of information technology at the University of Technology Sydney (UTS).
