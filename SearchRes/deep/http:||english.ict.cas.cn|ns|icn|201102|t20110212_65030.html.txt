The conference “Hadoop in China 2010” held by the Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences (ICT) concluded on Sep. 4 in Beijing.
Sloganed as “Communication, Understanding and Practice”, the conference aimed to exchange views on Hadoop technology, better understand the Internet’ applications’ need for cloud computing (CC) technology, and facilitate the practice of CC technology represented by Hadoop. It has gradually become an integrated platform for exchanging technologies and achievements since last year.  
The conference attracted more than 600 participants, marking the formation of Hadoop volunteer community that would be one of the main forces to promote Hadoop technology in China. The latest achievements in CC field were demonstrated at the conference.
“ICT has been supporting open source”, said SUN Ninghui, deputy director of ICT. He also extended gratitude to those who had contributed to Hadoop volunteer community, and expressed hope that “Hadoop in China” would be a banner for promoting Hadoop technology and open source code in China.
Hadoop，a specific technology in CC, is a set of software tools widely used in data processing . Similar to grid computing, CC essentially changes the way for supply and use of resources by full use of the Internet. Yet, it places more emphasis on the innovation of its application and usage pattern which has been greatly boosted by open source code. 
Rather than leading to cut-throat competition, the crowdsourcing, open source code proved to be a fountain of core competitiveness of enterprises. The open source software represented by Hadoop reflects the grass-roots culture of CC. It can be predicted that CC will promote more advanced and popular novel applications and the CC industry in China will enjoy a promising future.
