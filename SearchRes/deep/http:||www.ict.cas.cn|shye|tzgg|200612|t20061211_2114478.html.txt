Call for PapersThe 6th International Conference on Grid and Cooperative ComputingUrumchi, Xinjiang, China, August 16-18, 2007
Recent years have seen rapid advances in various grid-related technologies, middleware, and applications. The GCC conference has become one of the largest scientific events worldwide in grid and cooperative computing. The 6th international conference on grid and cooperative computing (GCC2007) is to be held from August 16 to 18, 2007 in Urumchi, Xinjiang, China. Located at the northern foot of the snow-capped Tianshan Mountains, Urumchi is the capital of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region and the last stopover on the westward journey along the "Silk Road". 
GCC2007 will be a stimulating forum for researchers and practitioners in related fields, where people get together to exchange ideas, experiences, and up-to-date technological advances. We invite the submission of papers related to various aspects of grid and cooperative computing. The main topics of interest include, but are not limited to: -    Theory of grid computing-    Service-oriented foundation of grid computing-    Peer-to-peer architecture -    Novel grid architectures -    Grid middleware-    Resource organization and management for grid computing -    Resource virtualization for grid computing-    Grid workflow and service composition-    Grid usage models and portal tools-    Grid programming models and environments-    Engineering approaches for grid applications -    Semantic basis for grid computing -    Grid interoperability-    Grid monitoring and accounting-    Quality of service, performance, and deployment issues -    Security, dependability, survivability, and reliability issues in grid computing-    Domain-specific approaches to grid engineering -    Software engineering support for grid and cooperative computing-    Technologies and practices of computer-supported cooperative work -    Empirical study of real-world applications or industrial case studies
Submission GuidelinesUnpublished original papers are solicited. The proceedings of GCC2007 will be published by IEEE Computer Society. Papers must be written in English and should be at most 15 pages, including bibliography and well-marked appendices. The manuscript should be in single column, double-spaced format, using a font size of 10 points or larger. Papers are to be submitted electronically to the following address, gcc2007@software.ict.ac.cn, in PDF or Windows-word format, with a separate sheet containing author(s) contact information.Submissions imply the willingness of at least one author to register, attend the conference, and present the paper. Selected papers will be considered for publication in the International Journal of Grid and Utility Computing (IJGUC), International Journal of Web Services Research, the Journal of Grid Computing and International Transactions on Systems Science and Applications (ITSSA).
