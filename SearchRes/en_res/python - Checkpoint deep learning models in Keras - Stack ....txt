I need help in implementing the checkpoint function in Keras. I am going to train a large dataset so in order to do that, first I trained a model using the iris flower dataset : http://machinelearningmastery.com/multi-class-classification-tutorial-keras-deep-learning-library/
since my own dataset is a lot similar to it only the difference is that my dataset is more bigger.
Now I am trying to implement the same checkpoint function in the iris-flower script. Here is what I tried so far.
This script produced the following error. I don't know how to troubleshoot it or maybe my arrangement in the script is wrong.
RuntimeError: Cannot clone object <keras.wrappers.scikit_learn.KerasClassifier object at 0x10e120fd0>, as the constructor does not seem to set parameter callbacks
 @Ling Ah right, it seems you are not the only one with this problem. Looking at this question and the source, it might be an error in the wrapper programming. You can try estimator = KerasClassifier(build_fn=baseline_model, **{validation_split=0.33, nb_epoch=200, batch_size=5, callbacks=callbacks_list, verbose=0}) although idk if itll help.
 thank you for your suggestion but it return a syntax error at  validation_split=0.33. I change the line that have single  =  to == but another error appeared saying that  validation_split is not defined
 @Ling Whops, sorry, my bad :S I meant estimator = KerasClassifier(build_fn=baseline_model, **{validation_split: 0.33, nb_epoch: 200, batch_size: 5, callbacks: callbacks_list, verbose: 0}). Although, as I said, Im not sure if that will fix it (Im not sure how exactly SciPy meta-trainers are implemented).
