Abstract: The key challenge of face recognition is to develop effective feature
inter-personal differences. In this paper, we show that it can be well solved
with deep learning and using both face identification and verification signals
same identity together, both of which are essential to face recognition. The
learned DeepID2 features can be well generalized to new identities unseen in
the training data. On the challenging LFW dataset, 99.15% face verification
accuracy is achieved. Compared with the best deep learning result on LFW, the
