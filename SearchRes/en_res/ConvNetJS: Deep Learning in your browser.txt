 ConvNetJS is a Javascript library for training Deep Learning models (Neural Networks) entirely in your browser. Open a tab and you're training. No software requirements, no compilers, no installations, no GPUs, no sweat. 
 The library allows you to formulate and solve Neural Networks in Javascript, and was originally written by @karpathy (I am a PhD student at Stanford). However, the library has since been extended by contributions from the community and more are warmly welcome. Current support includes:
 Ability to specify and train Convolutional Networks that process images
 An experimental Reinforcement Learning module, based on Deep Q Learning.
 Head over to Getting Started for a tutorial that lets you get up and running quickly, and discuss Documentation for all specifics.
 The code is available on Github under MIT license and I warmly welcome pull requests for new features / layers / demos and miscellaneous improvements. The library is also available on npm for use in Nodejs, under name convnetjs.
