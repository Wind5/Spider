 many problems in vision, audio, NLP, robotics, and other areas. In this course,
 you'll learn about methods for unsupervised feature learning and deep learning,
 which automatically learn a good representation of the input from unlabeled
 data. You'll also pick up the "hands-on," practical skills and tricks-of-the-trade 
 Basic knowledge of machine learning (supervised learning) is assumed, though we'll quickly
