Abstract: In recent years, deep learning has had a profound impact on machine learning
and artificial intelligence. At the same time, algorithms for quantum computers
have been shown to efficiently solve some problems that are intractable on
reduces the time required to train a deep restricted Boltzmann machine, but
also provides a richer and more comprehensive framework for deep learning than
of the underlying objective function. Our quantum methods also permit efficient
training of full Boltzmann machines and multi-layer, fully connected models and
