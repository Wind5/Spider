This year, we received a record 2145 valid submissions to the main conference, of which 1865 were fully reviewed (the others were either administratively rejected for technical or ethical reasons or withdrawn before review).
A total of 643 papers were accepted (29.9% of valid submissions). 83 of these were allocated long oral presentations (3.9% of valid submissions) and 123 were allocated short spotlight presentations (total of 9.7% of valid submissions have live presentations). All papers will appear also in the interactive session where posters are presented.
In CVPR 2016 we will have 3 presentation formats for accepted papers: 2 types of oral presentations (orals and spotlights) and poster presentations.
 - ORALS: equivalent to the traditional CVPR orals. CVPR 2016 will have a similar percentage of orals as in previous CVPRs. Each oral presentation will be 12 minutes long.
- SPOTLIGHTS: these are new to CVPR'16. Each spotlight presenter will have a 4 minute oral presentation to highlight the main contributions and novelties of their paper and to present its main results.
- POSTERS: the rest of the accepted papers are poster presentations.
In addition, all oral and spotlight papers will be presented at the following poster session.
Our rationale behind adding SPOTLIGHT presentations to CVPR'16 was to increase the number of authors who have the opportunity to present their work to a large audience and therefore gain maximum exposure and visibility. We believe that this new presentation format (oral/spotlight/poster) will make CVPR'16 a more exciting conference.
Authors will receive further practical instructions on how to prepare their spotlight presentations within the next few weeks.
