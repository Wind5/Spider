Key Features Get to grips with the deep learning concepts and set up Hadoop to put them to use. Implement and parallelize deep learning models on Hadoops YARN framework. A comprehensive tutorial to distributed deep learning with Hadoop Book Description Deep Learning involves extracting features and insights from multiple layers
Get to grips with the deep learning concepts and set up Hadoop to put them to use.
Deep Learning involves extracting features and insights from multiple layers of the data. This book will teach you how to deploy the deep learning networks with Hadoop.
Starting with understanding what deep learning is and what the various models associated with deep learning are, this book will then show you how to set up the Hadoop environment for deep learning. In this book, you will also learn how to overcome the challenges that you face while implementing distributed deep learning with Hadoop. The book will also show you how you can implement and parallelize Deep Belief Networks, CNN, RNN, RBM and much more using the popular deep learning library deeplearning4j. Get in depth mathematical explanations, visual representations to understand the implementation of Denoising AutoEncoders with deeplearning4j. To give you a more practical perspective, the book will also teach you how you can implement image classification, audio processing and natural language processing on Hadoop.
By the end of this book, you will know how to deploy deep learning in distributed systems using Hadoop
Understand the challenges of implementing distributed deep learning with Hadoop and how to overcome it
Get hands on practice of deep learning and their implementation with Hadoop.
