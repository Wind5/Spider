to achieve state-of-the-art performance on a wide variety of tasks such as
cross-entropy loss. In this paper, we demonstrate a small but consistent
advantage of replacing the softmax layer with a linear support vector machine.
Learning minimizes a margin-based loss instead of the cross-entropy loss. While
there have been various combinations of neural nets and SVMs in prior art, our
results using L2-SVMs show that by simply replacing softmax with linear SVMs
gives significant gains on popular deep learning datasets MNIST, CIFAR-10, and
