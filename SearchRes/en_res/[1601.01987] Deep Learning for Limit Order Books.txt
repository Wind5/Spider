Abstract: This paper develops a new neural network architecture for modeling spatial
and specifically designed to take advantage of the spatial structure of limit
order books. The new architecture yields a low-dimensional model of price
movements deep into the limit order book, allowing more effective use of
information from deep in the limit order book (i.e., many levels beyond the
best bid and best ask). This "spatial neural network" models the joint
distribution of the state of the limit order book at a future time conditional
on the current state of the limit order book. The spatial neural network
outperforms other models such as the naive empirical model, logistic regression
neural networks strongly outperform the logistic regression model. Due to its
more effective use of information deep in the limit order book, the spatial
neural network especially outperforms the standard neural network in the tail
of the distribution, which is important for risk management applications. The
models are trained and tested on nearly 500 stocks. Techniques from deep
learning such as dropout are employed to improve performance. Due to the
