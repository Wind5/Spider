CIFAR10 / CIFAR100: 3232 natural image dataset with 10/100 categories ( http://www.cs.utoronto.ca/~kriz/cifar.html)
Caltech Silhouettes: 2828 binary images contains silhouettes of the Caltech 101 dataset
STL-10 dataset is an image recognition dataset for developing unsupervised feature learning, deep learning, self-taught learning algorithms. It is inspired by the CIFAR-10 dataset but with some modifications. http://www.stanford.edu/~acoates//stl10/
NORB: binocular images of toy figurines under various illumination and pose (http://www.cs.nyu.edu/~ylclab/data/norb-v1.0/)
COIL 20: different objects imaged at every angle in a 360 rotation(http://www.cs.columbia.edu/CAVE/software/softlib/coil-20.php)
COIL100: different objects imaged at every angle in a 360 rotation (http://www1.cs.columbia.edu/CAVE/software/softlib/coil-100.php)
Arcade Universe  An artificial dataset generator with images containing arcade games sprites such as tetris pentomino/tetromino objects. This generator is based on the O. Breleuxs bugland dataset generator.
Datasets generated for the purpose of an empirical evaluation of deep architectures (DeepVsShallowComparisonICML2007):
BackgroundCorrelation : controlling the degree of correlation in noisy MNIST backgrounds
Labelled Faces in the Wild: 13,000 images of faces collected from the web, labelled with the name of the person pictured (http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/lfw/)
20 newsgroups: classification task, mapping word occurences to newsgroup ID (http://qwone.com/~jason/20Newsgroups/)
Penn Treebank : used for next word prediction or next character prediction (http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~treebank/)
Broadcast News: large text dataset, classically used for next word prediction (http://www.ldc.upenn.edu/Catalog/CatalogEntry.jsp?catalogId=LDC97S44)
MovieLens: Two datasets available from http://www.grouplens.org. The first dataset has 100,000 ratings for 1682 movies by 943 users, subdivided into five disjoint subsets. The second dataset has about 1 million ratings for 3900 movies by 6040 users. 
Jester: This dataset contains 4.1 million continuous ratings (-10.00 to +10.00) of 100 jokes from 73,421 users.
Netflix Prize: Netflix released an anonymised version of their movie rating dataset; it consists of 100 million ratings, done by 480,000 users who have rated between 1 and all of the 17,770 movies.
Book-Crossing dataset: This dataset is from the Book-Crossing community, and contains 278,858 users providing 1,149,780 ratings about 271,379 books.
