Abstract: We develop a first line of attack for solving programming competition-style
problems from input-output examples using deep learning. The approach is to
train a neural network to predict properties of the program that generated the
outputs from the inputs. We use the neural network's predictions to augment
enumerative search and an SMT-based solver. Empirically, we show that our
approach leads to an order of magnitude speedup over the strong non-augmented
baselines and a Recurrent Neural Network approach, and that we are able to
solve problems of difficulty comparable to the simplest problems on programming
