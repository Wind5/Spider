Here we think about the brain in terms of these ideas. We hypothesize that (1)
the brain optimizes cost functions, (2) these cost functions are diverse and
problems posed by behavior. Such a heterogeneously optimized system, enabled by
a series of interacting cost functions, serves to make learning data-efficient
and precisely targeted to the needs of the organism. We suggest directions by
