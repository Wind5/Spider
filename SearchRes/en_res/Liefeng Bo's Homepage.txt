Biography: On August 2013, I joined Amazon as a senior research scientist. I also hold an affiliate faculty in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Washington (UW). My research interests are in Machine Learning, Computer Vision and Robotics. I was a senior research scientist at Intel Labs from 2012-2013 and a postdoc at the UW from 2010-2012 and at the Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago from 2008-2009. From 2002-2007, I was a PhD student at the Xidian University, where I received a doctorate in Electronic Engineering, with a specialization in Machine Learning.
