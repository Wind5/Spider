Enterprise workstations built forDeep LearningBacked by expert support from DL engineers.Lambda CustomersWhy use specialized hardware?Faster hardware tightens the feedback loop on your choice of network architecture, loss function, and other hyperparameters. Investing in proper hardware saves you hundreds of hours. Your time is worth it.CorporationsFaster hardware gets you to market quicker. The impact is significant. In 2017, Facebook reduced their training duration from 29 hours to 1 hour with a hardware upgrade.ResearchersMany of our team members come from Deep Learning research backgrounds. We know the clock is always ticking. Grants run out. You need to reduce the duration of your experiments from days to hours.Education InstitutionsA rapid feedback loop provides students with a faster pace of learning. Help them make the most of their education.Build your workstationWe pre-configure every workstationOur high performance workstations are built specifically for Deep Learning. They're pre-configured with the libraries you need.
