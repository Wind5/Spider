Abstract: We describe a learning-based approach to hand-eye coordination for robotic
grasping from monocular images. To learn hand-eye coordination for grasping, we
trained a large convolutional neural network to predict the probability that
task-space motion of the gripper will result in successful grasps, using only
monocular camera images and independently of camera calibration or the current
robot pose. This requires the network to observe the spatial relationship
between the gripper and objects in the scene, thus learning hand-eye
coordination. We then use this network to servo the gripper in real time to
achieve successful grasps. To train our network, we collected over 800,000
grasp attempts over the course of two months, using between 6 and 14 robotic
manipulators at any given time, with differences in camera placement and
