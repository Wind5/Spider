Abstract: We introduce two Python frameworks to train neural networks on large
datasets: Blocks and Fuel. Blocks is based on Theano, a linear algebra compiler
with CUDA-support. It facilitates the training of complex neural network models
symbolic computational graph, and providing an extensive set of utilities to
learning datasets. It allows the user to easily iterate over large datasets,
