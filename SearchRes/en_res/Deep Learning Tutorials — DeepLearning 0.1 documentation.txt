Deep Learning is a new area of Machine Learning research, which

The LISA public wiki has a reading list and a bibliography.
The tutorials presented here will introduce you to some of the most important deep learning
algorithms and will also show you how to run them using Theano. Theano is a python library that makes writing deep learning models easy, and gives the option of
The algorithm tutorials have some prerequisites. You should know some python,
and be familiar with numpy. Since this tutorial is about using Theano, you
should read over the Theano basic tutorial first. Once youve done that,
read through our Getting Started chapter  it introduces the notation, and downloadable datasets used in the algorithm tutorials, and the way we do optimization by stochastic gradient descent.
The purely supervised learning algorithms are meant to be read in order:
The unsupervised and semi-supervised learning algorithms can be read in any
order (the auto-encoders can be read independently of the RBM/DBN thread):
Stacked Denoising Auto-Encoders - easy steps into unsupervised pre-training for deep nets
Deep Belief Networks - unsupervised generative pre-training of stacked RBMs followed by supervised fine-tuning
Building towards including the mcRBM model, we have a new tutorial on sampling
Note that the tutorials here are all compatible with Python 2 and 3, with the exception of Modeling and generating sequences of polyphonic music with the RNN-RBM which is only available for Python 2.
