Aloha, I'm the chief scientist at Salesforce and an adjunct professor at Stanford's computer science department. Previously, I was the founder and CEO/CTO of MetaMind which was acquired by Salesforce in 2016. I enjoy improving the state of the art in AI through research (deep learning, natural language processing and computer vision) and making AI easily accessible to everyone.
In 2014, I got my PhD in the CS Department at Stanford and have been teaching there since, see CS224n - NLP with Deep Learning. 
This New York Times article covers one project from Salesforce Research.
Some videos and slides about deep learning and our research and applied work:
