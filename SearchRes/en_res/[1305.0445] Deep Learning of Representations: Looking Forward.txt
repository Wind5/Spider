Abstract: Deep learning research aims at discovering learning algorithms that discover
more abstract concepts. Although the study of deep learning has already led to
experiments, several challenges lie ahead. This paper proposes to examine some
of these challenges, centering on the questions of scaling deep learning
and powerful inference and sampling procedures, and learning to disentangle the
factors of variation underlying the observed data. It also proposes a few
