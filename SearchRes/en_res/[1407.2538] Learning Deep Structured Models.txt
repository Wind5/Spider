variables which are statistically related. Markov random fields (MRFs) are a
great mathematical tool to encode such relationships. The goal of this paper is
random variables. Towards this goal, we propose a training algorithm that is
able to learn structured models jointly with deep features that form the MRF
potentials. Our approach is efficient as it blends learning and inference and
makes use of GPU acceleration. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our
algorithm in the tasks of predicting words from noisy images, as well as
of the deep features and the MRF parameters results in significant performance
