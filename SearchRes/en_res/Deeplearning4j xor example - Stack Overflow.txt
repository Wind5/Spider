I'm trying to train an xor network with deeplearning4j, but i think i didn't really get how to use the dataset.
I wanted to create a NN with two inputs, two hidden neurons and one output neuron. 
 //Print the number of parameters in the network (and for each layer)
 System.out.println("Number of parameters in layer " + i + ": " + nParams);
o.d.o.s.BaseOptimizer - Objective function automatically set to minimize. Set stepFunction in neural net configuration to change default settings.
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Unable to getFloat row of non 2d matrix
I believe there is a XOR example straight from their git repository! 
The code is well documented and you can find it the repository here: https://github.com/deeplearning4j/dl4j-0.4-examples.git
