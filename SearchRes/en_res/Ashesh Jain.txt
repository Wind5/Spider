 I lead the team for sensor fusion and 3D tracking for autonomous driving at Zoox. My expertise are in real-world robotics systems with focus on machine (deep) learning, 3D perception, computer vision, and sensory-fusion.
 I obtained PhD in Computer Science from Cornell University in May 2016. I was a visiting research scholar at the Stanford AI Lab (from 2014-2016) where I started the Brain4Cars and RoboBrain projects. I graduated from IIT Delhi in 2012 with a Bachelors degree in Electrical Engineering.
 My research interest lies at the intersection of machine learning, robotics, and computer vision. Broadly, I build machine learning systems & algorithms for agents – such as robots, cars etc. – to learn from informative human signals at a large-scale. Most of my work has been in multi-modal sensor-rich robotic settings, for which I have developed sensory fusion deep learning architectures. I have developed and deployed algorithms on multiple robotic platforms (PR2, Baxter etc.), on cars, and crowd-sourcing systems.
