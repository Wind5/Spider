This video presentation was shown at the ICML Workshop for Open Source ML Software on June 25, 2010. It explains some of the features and algorithms of PyBrain and gives tutorials on how to install and use PyBrain for different tasks. 
and in some cases created interfaces to existing libraries (e.g. LIBSVM).
This list shows some of the methods you can use with PyBrain. 
PyBrain has an emphasis on network architectures, which can be trained and manipulated
with almost all of the algorithms offered by PyBrain. Here are some examples of available
Feed-forward networks, including Deep Belief Networks and Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBM)
Environments in PyBrain are scenarios or test cases, in which an agent can be trained 
or an algorithm can be tested. Environments share a common interface, thus making it 
very easy to switch agents. PyBrain comes with a view predefined most basic environments:
allows arbitrary objects to interact with themself and other objects in a pysically realistic way.
The scene can be rendered with OpenGL to give the user a precise information about what is going
