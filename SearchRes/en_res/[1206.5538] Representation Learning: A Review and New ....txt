Abstract: The success of machine learning algorithms generally depends on data
representations can entangle and hide more or less the different explanatory
factors of variation behind the data. Although specific domain knowledge can be
used to help design representations, learning with generic priors can also be
used, and the quest for AI is motivating the design of more powerful
recent work in the area of unsupervised feature learning and deep learning,
