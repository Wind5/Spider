Abstract: Despite its nonconvex nature, $\ell_0$ sparse approximation is desirable in
approximation problem with the tool of deep learning, by proposing Deep
$\ell_0$ Encoders. Two typical forms, the $\ell_0$ regularized problem and the
and pooling functions. Enforcing such structural priors acts as an effective
