 Want to know when to sell Bitcoins? Devavrat Shah and researchers at MIT are working on deep learning methods to predict prices. “The strategy experimented holds [a] minimal position — at most 1 Bitcoin (+ or −). This leads to nearly doubling of investment in 50 days".
 MIT Neurotech: Mapping the Brain with Connectomics. Through pairing nanoresolution 3D digitized brains with deep learning, researchers at Eyewire are able to analyze neural circuits at synaptic detail. This could help tp understand links between psychological disorders & miswirings in the brain.
 “The broad goal is to become the emotion layer of the Internet,” says Affectiva co-founder Rana el Kaliouby, a former MIT postdoc who invented the technology. “We believe there’s an opportunity to sit between any human-to-computer, or human-to-human interaction point, capture data, and use it to enrich the user experience.”
 "As an app for tagging and searching photos, it appears very rich. It tags smartphone photos using dozens of different categories, including place, date, object and scene. It also recognizes faces — either by connecting to your social networks and matching contacts with people in the photos, or by building collections of photos including the same face and letting users label them manually".

 The World Resources Institute have partnered with Orbital Insight, a startup that focuses on analyzing data from satellites using deep learning algorithms to monitor the extent of deforestation and find risk factors leading to high levels of deforestation.
 Andrew Ng is a leading voice in “deep learning,” a branch of artificial intelligence in which scientists try to get computers to “learn” for themselves by processing massive amounts of data. He was part of a team that in 2012 famously taught a network of computers to recognize cats after being shown millions of photos.
