succeesfully used for grasping novel objects, but required manual design of features for image and depth data.
We use deep learning, which allow us to learn the basic features used by our algorithm directly 
Our deep learning algorithm uses our novel structured multimodal regularization approach to encourage the learned features to use a subset of the input
modalities. This leads to more robust RGB-D features, especially when surface
