 Deep learning is one of the most fascinating learning techniques. MMLAB formulates novel deep models for various vision 
tasks such as face recognition, face alignment, pedestrian detection, and person parsing. 
 Automatically understanding the behaviors of crowd from video sequences is of great interest to the computer vision community, 
and has drawn more and more attentions in recent years. It has important applications to event recognition, traffic flow estimation, 
 Artists have a fascinating ability to capture the most distinctive characteristics of human faces and depict them on sketches. 
Although sketches are very different from photos in style and appearance, human beings often can easily recognize a person from his sketch. 
We design computer programs to also have such amazing abilities. Read More
 MMLAB develops fast and effective computing algorithms which can automatically conduct aesthetic assessment of large 
scale photo datasets inspired by the criteria and skills adopted by professional photographers. Read More
 We target on greatly improving user experience of web-based image search engines with extremely simple user interaction. 
It interprets usersâ€™ search intention with the minimum feedback effort: only one click on the query image from a pool 
 MMLAB develops novel algorithms for automatically locating facial keypoints, aligning face images, and identifying or verifying a person from a digital image or a video stream. Read More
