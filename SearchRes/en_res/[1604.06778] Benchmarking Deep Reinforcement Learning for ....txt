learning. Some notable examples include training agents to play Atari games
based on raw pixel data and to acquire advanced manipulation skills using raw
sensory inputs. However, it has been difficult to quantify progress in the
domain of continuous control due to the lack of a commonly adopted benchmark.
In this work, we present a benchmark suite of continuous control tasks,
including classic tasks like cart-pole swing-up, tasks with very high state and
based on the systematic evaluation of a range of implemented reinforcement
