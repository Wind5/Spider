Abstract: Deeper neural networks are more difficult to train. We present a residual
learning framework to ease the training of networks that are substantially
deeper than those used previously. We explicitly reformulate the layers as
learning residual functions with reference to the layer inputs, instead of
showing that these residual networks are easier to optimize, and can gain
accuracy from considerably increased depth. On the ImageNet dataset we evaluate
residual nets with a depth of up to 152 layers---8x deeper than VGG nets but
still having lower complexity. An ensemble of these residual nets achieves
3.57% error on the ImageNet test set. This result won the 1st place on the
ILSVRC 2015 classification task. We also present analysis on CIFAR-10 with 100
The depth of representations is of central importance for many visual
recognition tasks. Solely due to our extremely deep representations, we obtain
a 28% relative improvement on the COCO object detection dataset. Deep residual
nets are foundations of our submissions to ILSVRC & COCO 2015 competitions,
where we also won the 1st places on the tasks of ImageNet detection, ImageNet
