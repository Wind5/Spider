Changing the course of genomic medicineToday, machine learning and experimental biology are advancing at an exponential pace. Deep Genomics is where these disciplines meet. Our systems predict the molecular effects of genetic variation, opening a new and exciting path to discovery for disease diagnostics and therapies.Learn More
Founded in 2015, Deep Genomics brings together world-leading expertise in machine learning and genome biology. Weâ€™re inventing a new generation of computational technologies that predict what will happen within a cell when DNA is altered by genetic variation, whether natural or therapeutic.Our clients and partners use our technology to discover and design diagnostics and therapies in computers, before they even reach the lab. Deep Genomics addresses the following needs:Target bio-marker discoveryInterpretation of genetic variationGenome-based therapeutic developmentMolecular diagnostics and carrier screeningRisk assessment for complex disordersBecause our system models fundamental aspects of molecular biology, it can be used for any variant and any disease.
