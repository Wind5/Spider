Dr. Arno Candel is Chief Architect at H2O.ai. He is considered one of the leading deep learning experts. He has over a decade of experience in high-performance computing. In past he has designed and implemented high-performance machine learning algorithms. Arno was named 2014 Big Data All-Star by Fortune Magazine. 
I recently got to hear from him last month at H2O World 2015 which I would love to share with everyone. While most the tips are generic, there are some which are specific to H2O.
Here are top 10 deep learning tips and tricks as per Arno:
Model size is independent of number of rows or training time
If model is taking too long, cancel and decrease model complexity
 Python overtakes R, becomes the leader in Data Science, Machine Learning platforms
