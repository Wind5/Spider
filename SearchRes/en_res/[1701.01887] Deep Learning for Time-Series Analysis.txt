Abstract: In many real-world application, e.g., speech recognition or sleep stage
classification, data are captured over the course of time, constituting a
otherwise identical points of time to belong to different classes or predict
that were expensive to create and required expert knowledge of the field. With
the advent of Deep Learning new models of unsupervised learning of features for
are the topic of this paper: a review of the main Deep Learning techniques is
results make it clear that Deep Learning has a lot to contribute to the field.
