 I gave a keynote talk on Computational Modeling on Social Dynamics in DSBDA workshop in ICDM 2016. 
 Our paper on social group evolution was included in the Best Papers of KDD 2016 special issue in ACM TKDD.
 With Wenwu Zhu, Tat-Seng Chua and Ramesh Jain we publish a perspective and vision paper Social-Sensed Multimedia Computing in IEEE Multimedia Magazine.
 Peng Cui is an Associate Professor in Tsinghua University. He got his PhD degree from Tsinghua University in 2010. He is keen to promote the convergence of social media data mining and multimedia computing technologies. His research interests include network representation learning, human behavioral modeling, and social-sensed multimedia computing. He has published more than 60 papers in prestigious conferences and journals in data mining and multimedia. His recent research won the SIGKDD 2016 Best Paper Finalist, ICDM 2015 Best Student Paper Award, SIGKDD 2014 Best Paper Finalist, IEEE ICME 2014 Best Paper Award, ACM MM12 Grand Challenge Multimodal Award, and MMM13 Best Paper Award. He is the Area Chair of ICDM 2016, ACM MM 2014-2015, IEEE ICME 2014-2015, ICASSP 2013, Associate Editors of IEEE TKDE, ACM TOMM, Elsevier Journal on Neurocomputing, and Guest Editors of IEEE Intelligent Systems, Information Retrieval Journal, Machine Vision and Applications, etc. He was the recipient of ACM China Rising Star Award in 2015.
 My research interests include social network analysis and social multimedia computing. In social network analysis, I foucs more
 on computational modeling of complex user behaviors, including individual user behavior prediction, social group analysis and information propogation modeling. In social multimedia computing, I am keen to promote the convergence of user behavioral modeling and multimedia content analysis, with the ultimate goal to bridge the gap between multimedia data and user needs.
