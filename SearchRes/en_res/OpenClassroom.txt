Introduction to fundamental techniques for designing and analyzing algorithms, including asymptotic analysis; divide-and-conquer algorithms and recurrences; greedy algorithms; data structures; dynamic programming; graph algorithms; and randomized algorithms. 
Introduction to applied machine learning. In this course, you'll learn about machine learning techniques such
 as linear regression, logistic regression, naive Bayes, SVMs, clustering, and more. In addition, 
 you'll also learn the practical, hands-on, skills and techniques needed to get learning techniques
