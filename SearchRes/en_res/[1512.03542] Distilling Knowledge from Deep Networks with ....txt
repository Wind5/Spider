Abstract: Exponential growth in Electronic Healthcare Records (EHR) has resulted in new
Deep Learning models have shown superior performance for robust prediction in
features from deep learning models such as Stacked Denoising Autoencoder and
time-series dataset show that our method obtains similar or better performance
than the deep learning models, and it provides interpretable phenotypes for
