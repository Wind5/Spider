I my case - at input I have List<List<Float>> (list of word representation vectors). And - have one Double at output from one sequence.
So I building next structure (first index - example number, second - sentence item number, third - word vector element number) : http://pastebin.com/KGdjwnki
But when I masting one of next (http://pastebin.com/wvFFC4Hw) to model.output - I getting vector [0.25, 0.24, 0.25, 0.25], not one value.
What can be wrong? Attached code (at Kotlin). classCount is one.
upd. Seems like next example have "near" task, so later I'll check it and post solution : https://github.com/deeplearning4j/dl4j-0.4-examples/blob/master/dl4j-examples/src/main/java/org/deeplearning4j/examples/recurrent/word2vecsentiment/Word2VecSentimentRNN.java
 Hi Alexander - Can you ask this question in the Deeplearning4j Gitter channel? gitter.im/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j And use gist gist.github.com to share your code? The community is actively answering questions there...
next to the recommendation to post this in the very active gitter and the hint of Adam to check out the great documentation, which explains how to set up the in- and output being of rank 3, I want to point out a few other things in your code, as I was struggling with similar problems:
check out the basic example here in examples/recurrent/basic/BasicRNNExample.java, here you see that for RNN you don't use model.output(xItem), but model.rnnTimeStep(xItem);
with class count of one you seem to be performing a regression, for that also check out the regression examples at examples/feedforward/regression/RegressionSum.java and documenation here, here you see that as an activiation function you should use "identity". "softmax" actually normalizes the output to sum up to one (see in glossary), so if you have just one output it will always output 1 (at least it did for my problem).
