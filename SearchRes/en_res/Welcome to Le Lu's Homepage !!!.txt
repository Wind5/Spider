understanding and semantic parsing to fit into revolutionary  clinical workflow practices.
& validation via large scale clinical imaging datasets; and mapping the
and video computing (from 2D/3D to 3D and 4D) towards medical imaging.
Recently, I won the Best Summer Intern Mentor Award 2013, NIH Clinical Center
(only one from my institute); and  the Postbac Mentor of the Year Award
was a Senior Staff Scientist, Image Analytics and Informatics, at Siemens
Corporate Research, from Nov. 2011 until Jan. 2013. I was a Staff Scientist at
Siemens Computer Aided Diagnosis (CAD) Group, Siemens Medical Solutions at Malvern, Pennsylvania,
from Nov. 2009 to Oct. 2011. I worked as a Research Scientist in Siemens
Corporate Research (SCR), a Division of Siemens Corporation, Princeton, New Jersey
from Oct. 2006 to Oct. 2009, closely collaborating with CAD group. I enjoyed
working with a number of excellent Siemens colleagues and interns for a very
productive period of time (6.28 years). Our efforts result in 10+ deployed
and my advisor is Prof. Gregory D. Hager. I also worked closely with Prof.
Laurant Younes and Prof. Rene Vidal at Hopkins. I interned twice at Microsoft
Research Beijing and Redmond during 2000~2001, and 2004 summer with Dr. Harry
(Heung-Yeung) Shum and Dr. Kentaro Toyama, respectively. I was a graduate
student (1996-1999) with Dr. Zhanyi Hu at NLPR, CAS, Beijing, China.
