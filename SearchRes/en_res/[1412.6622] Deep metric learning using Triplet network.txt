Abstract: Deep learning has proven itself as a successful set of models for learning
learned as part of a classification task. In this paper we propose the triplet
comparisons. A similar model was defined by Wang et al. (2014), tailor made for
learning a ranking for image information retrieval. Here we demonstrate using
various datasets that our model learns a better representation than that of its
