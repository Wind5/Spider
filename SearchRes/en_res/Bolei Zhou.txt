  I am a fifth-year Ph.D. Candidate in Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) at MIT, advised by Prof. Antonio Torralba. I got the M.Eng. in Information Engineering at CUHK in July 2012 and B.Eng. in Biomedical Engineering at SJTU in
  My research is on computer vision and machine learning, particularly I am interested in the visual recognition and the research on interpretable AI systems that tries to understand what's going on and what has been learned inside the complex 'black-box' models such as deep neural networks.
