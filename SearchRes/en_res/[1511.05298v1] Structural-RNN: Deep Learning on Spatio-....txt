That is while many problems in computer vision inherently have an underlying
high-level structure and can benefit from it. Spatio-temporal graphs are a
formulation of real world problems. In this paper, we propose an approach for
success of Recurrent Neural Networks~(RNNs). We develop a scalable method for
casting an arbitrary spatio-temporal graph as a rich RNN mixture that is
is generic and principled as it can be used for transforming any
spatio-temporal graph through employing a certain set of well defined steps.
The evaluations of the proposed approach on a diverse set of problems, ranging
from modeling human motion to object interactions, shows improvement over the
state-of-the-art with a large margin. We expect this method to empower a new
