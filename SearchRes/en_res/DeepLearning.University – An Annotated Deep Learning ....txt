I was unable to find a place which talked about the mathematical stack required to understand deep learning. I put one together at http://rlucente.blogspot.com/2014/08/deep-learning-mathematical-stack.html. However, I am a novice and not sure if it is correct. Please take a look and make any necessary comments.
I think A Unified Energy-Based Framework for Unsupervised Learning is a very good theoretical paper in this field. It discusses the optimization objectives of a few unsupervised learning algorithms, including RBM and others, and how these objectives determine the properties of the solution found.
