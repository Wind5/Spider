The aim of this group is to bring together people interested in the family of machine learning methods that are concerned with learning distributed, hierarchical ("deep") representations. Neural Networks being the most popular implementation.  
The format will be based around guest speakers sharing new research ideas and applications covering a wide range of fields from computer vision and natural language processing to autonomous systems and prognostics. 
Persontyle has started this community as part of their wider initiative for people to learn the art and science of turning data into meaningful insights. The vision is for this group to be an open platform for people to share knowledge, practices, research, applications and critiques of deep learning. 
We are always on the lookout for interesting speakers and topics. If interested, get in touch.
