Abstract: Collaborative filtering (CF) is a successful approach commonly used by many
items by users as the sole source of information for learning to make
topic regression (CTR) is an appealing recent method taking this approach which
tightly couples the two components that learn from two different sources of
information. Nevertheless, the latent representation learned by CTR may not be
very effective when the auxiliary information is very sparse. To address this
problem, we generalize recent advances in deep learning from i.i.d. input to
non-i.i.d. (CF-based) input and propose in this paper a hierarchical Bayesian
datasets from different domains show that CDL can significantly advance the
