 ProjectThe Study of Deeper Learning: Opportunities and Outcomes examines how some schools have provided opportunities for students to acquire deeper learning skills and how these opportunities are related to student outcomes. The deeper learning theory of action assumes that opportunities to engage in deeper learning activities help students to develop three types of deeper learning competencies: cognitive (mastery of core content, critical thinking skills), interpersonal (collaboration skills, communication skills), and intrapersonal (learning-how-to-learn skills, academic mindsets).
Funded by the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation, the study includes 20 high schools that focus on deeper learning skills (“network schools”) as well as a matched sample of comparison (“non-network”) schools. All twenty schools belonged to one of ten deeper learning networks and had a mature and at least moderately well-implemented approach to promoting deeper learning.
In a series of reports, AIR researchers compare the strategies and cultures, students’ deeper learning opportunities, and student outcomes between students who attended network schools and non-network schools. Exploratory analyses also cover relationships among opportunities for deeper learning, deeper learning competencies, and students’ on-time high school graduation.

The Shape of Deeper Learning: Strategies, Structures, and Cultures in Deeper Learning Network High Schools (Report #1, September 2014) 
Research question: What strategies, structures, and cultures are common among deeper learning network schools, and how do they differ from those observed in non-network schools?
Research question: Do students attending deeper learning network schools experience more opportunities for deeper learning than they would have experienced in similar non-network schools?
Research question: Do students attending deeper learning network schools experience better outcomes than similar students in matched non-network schools?
