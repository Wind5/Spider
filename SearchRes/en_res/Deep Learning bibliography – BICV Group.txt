Learning the meaning of a novel noun from a few labeled objects is one of the simplest aspects of learning a language, but approximating human performance on this task is still a significant challenge for current machine learning systems. Current methods typically fail to find the appropriate level of generalization in a concept hierarchy for a given visual stimulus. Recent work in cognitive science on Bayesian models of word learning partially addresses this challenge, but it assumes that the labels of objects are given (hence no object recognition) and it has only been evaluated in small domains. We present a system for learning nouns directly from images, using probabilistic predictions generated by visual classifiers as the input to Bayesian word learning, and compare this system to human performance in an automated, large-scale experiment. The system captures a significant proportion of the variance in human responses. Combining the uncertain outputs of the visual classifiers with the ability to identify an appropriate level of abstraction that comes from Bayesian word learning allows the system to outperform alternatives that either cannot deal with visual stimuli or use a more conventional computer vision approach.

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) have had great success in machine learning tasks involving vision and represent one of the early successes of deep networks. Local receptive fields and weight sharing make their architecture ideally suited for vision tasks by helping to enforce a prior based on our knowledge of natural images. This same prior could also be applied to recent developments in the field of deep networks, in order to tailor these new architectures for artificial vision. In this context, we show how the Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM), the building block of Deep Belief Networks (DBN), can be adapted to operate in a convolutional manner. We compare their performance to standard fully-connected RBMs on a simple visual learning task and show that the convolutional RBMs (CRBMs) converge to smaller values of the negative likelihood function. Our experiments also indicate that CRBMs are more efficient than standard RBMs trained on small image patches, with the CRBMs having faster convergence.
