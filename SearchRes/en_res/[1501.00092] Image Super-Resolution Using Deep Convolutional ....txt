Abstract: We propose a deep learning method for single image super-resolution (SR). Our
images. The mapping is represented as a deep convolutional neural network (CNN)
that takes the low-resolution image as the input and outputs the
methods can also be viewed as a deep convolutional network. But unlike
optimizes all layers. Our deep CNN has a lightweight structure, yet
extend our network to cope with three color channels simultaneously, and show
