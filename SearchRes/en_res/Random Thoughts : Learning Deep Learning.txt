There are lots of awesome reading lists or posts that summarized materials related to Deep Learning. So why would I commit another one? Well, the primary objective is to develop a complete reading list that allows readers to build a solid academic and practical background of Deep Learning. And this list is developed while I’m preparing my Deep Learning workshop. My research is related to Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) in general. Hence, this posts tends to summary contributions in DNNs instead of generative models.
If you have no idea about Machine Learning and Scientific Computing, I suggest you learn the following materials while you are reading Machine Learning or Deep Learning books. You don’t have to master these materials, but basic understanding is important. It’s hard to open a meaningful conversation if the person has no idea about matrix or single variable calculus.
 Differential Equations by Arthur Mattuck, Haynes Miller, Jeremy Orloff, John Lewis.
Deep Learning is a fast-moving community. Therefore the line between “Recent Advances” and “Literature that matter” is kind of blurred. Here I collected articles that are either introducing fundamental algorithms, techniques or highly cited by the community.

 WWW Crowd Dataset by Jing Shao, Kai Kang, Chen Change Loy, and Xiaogang Wang.
I configured 2 types of GPU instances that are available in AWS and installed necessary software for Deep Learning practice. The first one is DGYDLGPUv4. It is a machine that provides 8-core CPU, 15GB RAM, 500GB SSD and 1 NVIDIA Grid K520 GPU, you can use it to learn Deep Learning or conduct normal size experiment. If you need even more computing resources, you can choose DGYDLGPUXv1. This new released GPU instance offered a 32-core CPU, 60GB RAM, 500GB SSD and 4 NVIDIA Grid K520 GPUs.
Currently they are only available at Asia Pacific (Singapore). You can copy the instance to your close region.
If you are doing analysis or experiments, I suggest you to request spot instance instead of on-demand instance. This will save you a lot of costs.
Currently, my build of Caffe in the instance is failed. You can use the AMI that is provided by Caffe community. You can get more details from here
So far the instance is only available at US East (N. Virginia)
