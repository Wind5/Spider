AI is completely reshaping life sciences, medicine, and healthcare as an industry. To further that transformation, NVIDIA is democratizing deep learning by providing an end-to-end AI computing platform designed for the healthcare community. These GPU-accelerated solutions are helping foster collaboration, while at the same time keeping each institution’s information secure. 
GPU-accelerated deep learning solutions can be used to design more sophisticated neural networks for healthcare and medical research applications—from real-time pathology assessment to point-of-care interventions to predictive analytics for clinical decision-making.  Innovations in AI are advancing the future of precision medicine and population health management in unbelievable ways.
The NVIDIA Deep Learning GPU Training System (DIGITS™) puts the power of deep learning in the hands of data scientists and researchers. DIGITS lets you quickly design the best neural network for medical imaging, helping with classification, detection, or segmentation. 
It takes large amounts of computationally expensive research to develop better cancer drugs, faster genomic analysis, and more precise imaging results. NVIDIA® DGX™ is the world's first purpose-built system for deep learning, with fully integrated hardware and software for quick and easy deployment.  
From advancing the fight against breast cancer to tracking vaccinations in developing countries, AI and deep learning are helping to solve today’s most urgent healthcare challenges.
