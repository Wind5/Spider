Abstract: Deep learning has been shown as a successful machine learning method for a
variety of tasks, and its popularity results in numerous open-source deep
learning software tools. Training a deep network is usually a very
learning, many tools exploit hardware features such as multi-core CPUs and
many-core GPUs to shorten the training time. However, different tools exhibit
deep networks on different hardware platforms, which makes it difficult for end
users to select an appropriate pair of software and hardware. In this paper, we
aim to make a comparative study of the state-of-the-art GPU-accelerated deep
We first benchmark the running performance of these tools with three popular
types of neural networks on two CPU platforms and three GPU platforms. We then
two-fold. First, for end users of deep learning tools, our benchmarking results
can serve as a guide to selecting appropriate hardware platforms and software
tools. Second, for software developers of deep learning tools, our in-depth
analysis points out possible future directions to further optimize the running
