Video is the world’s largest generator of data, captured by hundreds of millions of cameras in areas like government property, public transit, commercial buildings, and roadways. The number of cameras is expected to rise to more than one billion by 2020. AI technology enables powerful intelligent video analytics that can turn this staggering number of pixels into public safety and smart city solutions.
NVIDIA Metropolis is the foundation of the AI City—an edge-to-cloud platform that can turn anonymized video into valuable insights. Driven by powerful technologies like NVIDIA® Jetson™ TX2 at the edge and NVIDIA Tesla® in the data center, it delivers intelligent video analytics for a wide range of applications.
AI is changing how we capture, inspect, and analyze data. This impacts everything from public safety to traffic and parking management to law enforcement and city services. Metropolis gives you the tools, technologies, and support to address it all with smarter, faster applications.
