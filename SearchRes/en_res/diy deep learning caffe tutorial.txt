 This tutorial is designed to equip researchers and developers with the
 tools and know-how needed to incorporate deep learning into their work. Both
 the ideas and implementation of state-of-the-art deep learning models will
 be presented. While deep learning and deep features have recently achieved
 strong results in many tasks, a common framework and shared models are
 needed to advance further research and applications and reduce the barrier
 To this end we present the Caffe framework that offers an
 open-source library, public reference models, and working examples for deep
 learning. Join our tour from the 1989 LeNet for digit recognition to today's
 top ILSVRC14 vision models and beyond to detection, vision + language, and
 Sunday, June 7 at 2pm — 6pm in room 200.
 There will a break for open discussion and coffee at 3:30 – 4:15pm.
Cloud instances with Caffe were made available during the tutorial for
attendees to follow along thanks to the NVIDIA qwiklabs infrastructure. No need
Beginners: you will be equipped with the tools and know-how to begin or improve your deep learning toolkit through talks, worked examples, and demos.
Intermediate: follow along for a walkthrough of model definition and development, framework extension, and tips and tricks in practice will be covered.
Advanced: join for discussion of modeling and optimization as well as news of the latest developments brewing in Caffe.
