 Deep Learning for Answer Sentence SelectionArticle · December 2014 with 291 ReadsSource: arXivCite this publication1st Lei Yu2nd Karl Moritz Hermann3rd Phil Blunsom4th Stephen PulmanAbstractAnswer sentence selection is the task of identifying sentences that contain
the answer to a given question. This is an important problem in its own right
as well as in the larger context of open domain question answering. We propose
a novel approach to solving this task via means of distributed representations,
and learn to match questions with answers by considering their semantic
encoding. This contrasts prior work on this task, which typically relies on
and various external resources. Our approach does not require any feature
engineering nor does it involve specialist linguistic data, making this model
easily applicable to a wide range of domains and languages. Experimental

Identifying High Quality Document–Summary Pairs through Text Matching[Show abstract] [Hide abstract] ABSTRACT: Text summarization namely, automatically generating a short summary of a given document, is a difficult task in natural language processing. Nowadays, deep learning as a new technique has gradually been deployed for text summarization, but there is still a lack of large-scale high quality datasets for this technique. In this paper, we proposed a novel deep learning method to identify high quality document–summary pairs for building a large-scale pairs dataset. Concretely, a long short-term memory (LSTM)-based model was designed to measure the quality of document–summary pairs. In order to leverage information across all parts of each document, we further proposed an improved LSTM-based model by removing the forget gate in the LSTM unit. Experiments conducted on the training set and the test set built upon Sina Weibo (a Chinese microblog website similar to Twitter) showed that the LSTM-based models significantly outperformed baseline models with regard to the area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) value.Article · Jun 2017 Yongshuai HouYang XiangBuzhou Tang+1 more author...Qingcai ChenReadOur work belongs to text based QA where the answer is a sentence. In recent years, neuquestion correct answer question generated by Dual QG question generated byBasicHu et al., 2014;Yu et al., 2014;Yin et al., 2015) show promising ability in modeling the semantic relation between sentences and achieve strong performances on QA tasks. Question generation also draws a lot of attentions in recent years. Question Answering and Question Generation as Dual Tasks[Show abstract] [Hide abstract] ABSTRACT: We study the problem of joint question answering (QA) and question generation (QG) in this paper. Our intuition is that QA and QG have intrinsic connections and these two tasks could improve each other. On one side, the QA model judges whether the generated question of a QG model is relevant to the answer. On the other side, the QG model provides the probability of generating a question given the answer, which is a useful evidence that in turn facilitates QA. In this paper we regard QA and QG as dual tasks. We propose a novel training framework that trains the models of QA and QG simultaneously, and explicitly leverages their probabilistic correlation to guide the training process. We implement a QG model based on sequence-to-sequence learning, and a QA model based on recurrent neural network. All the parameters involved in these two tasks are jointly learned with back propagation. Experimental results on two datasets show that our approach improves both QA and QG tasks.Article · Jun 2017 · IEEE Signal Processing LettersDuyu TangNan DuanTao QinMing ZhouMing ZhouReadThe task is to rank candidate answers based on their relatedness to the question. Questions with all positive and all negative responses were removed for models by[(Feng et al., 2015) and (Tan et al., 2015)], resulting in 1162 training questions, 65 dev questions and 68 test questions, while for the model by (Yu et al., 2014)], the dataset (without any filtering) contained 1229 training, 82 dev and 100 test questions. The metrics used for comparing different models is the MAP (Mean Average Precision) and MRR (Mean Reciprocal Rank). A survey of Community Question Answering[Show abstract] [Hide abstract] ABSTRACT: With the advent of numerous community forums, tasks associated with the same have gained importance in the recent past. With the influx of new questions every day on these forums, the issues of identifying methods to find answers to said questions, or even trying to detect duplicate questions, are of practical importance and are challenging in their own right. This paper aims at surveying some of the aforementioned issues, and methods proposed for tackling the same.Article · May 2017 · IEEE Signal Processing LettersBarun PatraReadIn the same direction, Bordes et al.[19]used a type of siamese network for learning to project question and answer pairs into a joint space.

Applying a Convolutional Neural Network to Legal Question Answering[Show abstract] [Hide abstract] ABSTRACT: Our legal question answering system combines legal information retrieval and textual entailment, and we describe a legal question answering system that exploits a deep convolutional neural network. We have evaluated our system using the training/test data from the competition on legal information extraction/entailment (COLIEE). The competition focuses on the legal information processing related to answering yes/no questions from Japanese legal bar exams, and it consists of three phases: ad-hoc legal information retrieval, textual entailment, and a learning model-driven combination of the two phases. Phase 1 requires the identification of Japan civil law articles relevant to a legal bar exam query. For that phase, we have implemented a combined TF-IDF and Ranking SVM information retrieval component. Phase 2 requires the system to answer “Yes” or “No” to previously unseen queries, by comparing extracted meanings of queries with relevant articles. Our training of an entailment model focuses on features based on word embeddings, syntactic similarities and identification of negation/antonym relations. We augment our textual entailment component with a convolutional neural network with dropout regularization and Rectified Linear Units. To our knowledge, our study is the first to adapt deep learning for textual entailment. Experimental evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of the convolutional neural network and dropout regularization. The results show that our deep learning-based method outperforms our baseline SVM-based supervised model and K-means clustering.

Legal Question Answering using Ranking SVM and Deep Convolutional Neural Network[Show abstract] [Hide abstract] ABSTRACT: This paper presents a study of employing Ranking SVM and Convolutional Neural Network for two missions: legal information retrieval and question answering in the Competition on Legal Information Extraction/Entailment. For the first task, our proposed model used a triple of features (LSI, Manhattan, Jaccard), and is based on paragraph level instead of article level as in previous studies. In fact, each single-paragraph article corresponds to a particular paragraph in a huge multiple-paragraph article. For the legal question answering task, additional statistical features from information retrieval task integrated into Convolutional Neural Network contribute to higher accuracy.

End-to-end deep neural networks (DNN) can avoid complex feature engineering and has much stronger learning ability than former learning algorithms; hence, it has become a main flow in mining QA matching[6]?[9]. Answer Selection in Community Question Answering via Attentive Neural Networks[Show abstract] [Hide abstract] ABSTRACT: Answer selection in community question answering is a challenging task in natural language processing. The difficulty lies in that it not only needs the consideration of semantic matching between question answer pairs but also requires a serious modeling of contextual factors. In this paper, we propose an attentive deep neural network architecture so as to learn the deterministic information for answer selection. The architecture can support various input formats through the organization of Convolutional Neural Networks, attention-based Long Short Term Memory and Conditional Random Fields. Experiments are carried out on the SemEval-2015 cQA dataset. We attain 58.35% on macro averaged F1, which outperforms the Top-1 system in the shared task by 1.16% and improves the state-of-the-art deep neural network based method by 2.21%.Article · Mar 2017 Yang XiangQingcai ChenXiaolong WangYang QinYang QinReadShow moreRecommended publicationsDiscover more publications, questions and projects in Deep LearningArticleWork in progress — Open source usability evaluation: The case of MoodleOctober 2011 · Proceedings - Frontiers in Education ConferenceThe open source course management system, Moodle, is designed to help instructors deliver course materials to their students from a social constructivist perspective.
