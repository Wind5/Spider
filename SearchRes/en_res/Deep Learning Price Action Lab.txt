 It is now the right time to move to the next level of intelligent trading, all for free.DLPAL allows you to compete with quantitative hedge funds at the fraction of the cost.
 DLPAL identifies short-term trading strategies in historical price data that fulfill user-defined performance statistics and 
 risk/reward parameters. The program uses primitive attributes of price action, the open, high, low and close, to extract feature types in an unsupervised learning mode. The program then uses the extracted features in 
 supervised learning mode to identify strategies and systems of strategies that fulfill the user objectives. Historical attribute files are also created for use with supervised machine learning classifiers (PRO version.)
 Save time from programming and concentrate on trading. Hedge funds would prefer that you spend your time programming instead of 
 exploiting market anomalies and opportunities. This is how they make billions.DLPAL does not require any programming. Actually this program will write code you can immediately use. DLPAL generates code for strategies and systems for the Quantopian platform, Tradestation (EasyLanguage), Multicharts (EasyLanguage), NinjaTrader 7 and Amibroker AFL. Testing 
 trading strategies derived from price action using advanced machine learning is just a copy and paste away. 
 MANY TRADERS ARE STILL STRUGGLING WITH METHODS THAT NO LONGER WORK IN THE MARKETS.With DLPAL
 you can compete with the quant departments of large hedge funds that have been making billions in trading profits because of their ability to quickly identify and exploit anomalies in price action.
 Identifying and exploiting anomalies in price action fast is the key to profitable trading. DLPAL
 is based on a proprietary deep learning algorithm that produces the same output each time it encounters the same market conditions. The determinism in the algo operation and the absence of stochasticity are in compliance with the standards of scientific testing and analysis. DLPAL minimizes data-mining and data-snooping bias through the use of proprietary unsupervised learning method for feature extraction and selection. Several functions are available for validation of the results including a randomization tool for ranking the performance of strategies.
 DLPAL PRO offers three main functions and several useful toolsThe User can search for strategies in historical data of any timeframe, group them into systems and generate code. DLPAL
 can also be used as a scanner of EOD data to determine whether new opportunities have developed. In addition, the program can calculate directional move probabilities for any number of securities in EOD and higher timeframes. DLPAL PRO generates historical data files with attributes for use with supervised machine learning classification.
