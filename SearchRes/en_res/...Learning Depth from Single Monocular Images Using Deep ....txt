Abstract: In this article, we tackle the problem of depth estimation from single
monocular images. Compared with depth estimation using multiple images such as
stereo depth perception, depth from monocular images is much more challenging.
set new records for various vision applications. On the other hand, considering
the continuous characteristic of the depth values, depth estimations can be
problem. Therefore, here we present a deep convolutional neural field model for
estimating depths from single monocular images, aiming to jointly explore the
capacity of deep CNN and continuous CRF. In particular, we propose a deep
structured learning scheme which learns the unary and pairwise potentials of
continuous CRF in a unified deep CNN framework. We then further propose an
equally effective model based on fully convolutional networks and a novel
superpixel pooling method, which is $im 10$ times faster, to speedup the
patch-wise convolutions in the deep model. With this more efficient model, we
are able to design deeper networks to pursue better performance. Experiments on
both indoor and outdoor scene datasets demonstrate that the proposed method
