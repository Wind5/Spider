The Deep Learning group advances the state-of-the-art in deep learning to achieve general intelligence. We develop algorithms, models, and systems in deep supervised and unsupervised learning, deep reinforcement learning, and neural-symbolic reasoning, and then pursue breakthroughs in computer vision, natural language processing, multimodal intelligence, Internet information processing, and other relevant areas.
Researchers from the group have contributed to many projects that have had a significant impact in the academic community and led to the deployment of scenario-enabling AI products and services. A recent example is the computer vision API in Microsoft Cognitive Services, which provides the world’s first image-captioning cloud service. This service enables next-generation scenarios such as CaptionBot, Seeing AI, and empowers Microsoft Word and PowerPoint to create image descriptions automatically for millions of users.

This project aims at driving disruptive advances in vision and language intelligence. We believe future breakthroughs in multimodal intelligence will empower smart communications between humans and the world and enable next-generation scenarios such as a universal chatbot and intelligent augmented reality. To these ends, we are focusing on understanding, reasoning, and generation across language and vision, and creation of intelligent services, including vision-to-text captioning, text-to-vision generation, and question answering/dialog about images and videos.
This project aims to develop intelligent dialogue agents to help users effectively accomplish tasks via natural language conversation. A typical goal-oriented dialogue system contains three major components: natural language understanding (NLU), natural language generation (NLG), and dialogue management (DM) that consists of state tracking and policy learning. Our research focus is on deep reinforcement learning approaches for dialogue management in goal-oriented dialogue settings, including movie ticket booking, trip planning, sales assistant etc. User Simulator Training
To build a machine learning based intelligent system, we often need to collect training labels and feed them into the system. A useful lesson in machine learning is that "more data beats a clever algorithm". In the current days, through a commercial crowdsourcing platform, we can easily collect a large amount of labels at a cost of pennies per label. However, the labels obtained from crowdsourcing may be highly noisy. Training a machine learning model
By Xiaodong He, Principal Researcher, Microsoft Research For human beings, reading comprehension is a basic task, performed daily. As early as in elementary school, we can read an article, and answer questions about its key ideas and details. But for AI, full reading comprehension is still an elusive goal–but a necessary one if we’re going to measure and achieve general intelligence AI.  In practice, reading comprehension is necessary for many real-world scenarios, including customer support,
Three papers accepted to CVPR 17 and our team which included University of Adelaide and Australian National University won 1st place in the Visual Question Answering Challenge 2017. See the leaderboard and MSFTResearch Twitter.
Released the image captioning service in Microsoft Cognitive Services/Vision API. You can try the CaptionBot demo at http://CaptionBot.ai, or add it to your Skype and have a photo chat. The technology is based on our competition winning deep learning multimodal intelligence models.
Our Microsoft Research entry won 1st Prize, tied with Google, at the MS COCO Captioning Challenge 2015, achieved the highest score in the Turing Test among all submissions.
