 I am a Research Scienist at Snapchat located on Venice beach in Los Angeles. Before joining 
 Snapchat, I was a Research Scientist at Adobe Research in San Jose, California. I got my M.S. 
 and Ph.D. degrees from the ECE department of University of Illinois at Urbanan-Champaign (UIUC) 
 in 2010 and 2011, both under supervision of Professor Thomas Huang at Beckman Institute. Before 
 that, I received my Bachelor's degree with honor in the EEIS department from University of 
 My research interests are in the broad area of computer vision, machine learning, and image 
 processing. Specifically, I have extensive experience in the following research areas: 
 object recognition and detection, facial analysis, deep learning, subspace learning,
 supervised and unsupervised learning, sparse coding and sparse representation, image and
