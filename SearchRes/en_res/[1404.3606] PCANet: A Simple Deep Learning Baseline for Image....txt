Abstract: In this work, we propose a very simple deep learning network for image
histograms. In the proposed architecture, PCA is employed to learn multistage
filter banks. It is followed by simple binary hashing and block histograms for
indexing and pooling. This architecture is thus named as a PCA network (PCANet)
and can be designed and learned extremely easily and efficiently. For
comparison and better understanding, we also introduce and study two simple
variations to the PCANet, namely the RandNet and LDANet. They share the same
topology of PCANet but their cascaded filters are either selected randomly or
learned from LDA. We have tested these basic networks extensively on many
benchmark visual datasets for different tasks, such as LFW for face
Surprisingly, for all tasks, such a seemingly naive PCANet model is on par with
the state of the art features, either prefixed, highly hand-crafted or
carefully learned (by DNNs). Even more surprisingly, it sets new records for
many classification tasks in Extended Yale B, AR, FERET datasets, and MNIST
the potential of the PCANet serving as a simple but highly competitive baseline
