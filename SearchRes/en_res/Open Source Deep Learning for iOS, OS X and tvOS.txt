The goal is to support using pre-trained Deep Learning models on all Apples devices that have GPU(s). It is developed in Swift  to easily run on all platforms (iOS, OS X and tvOS)  and Metal  to efficiently use on-device GPU to ensure low-latency Deep Learning calculations. DeepLearningKit currently supports using (Deep) Convolutional Neural Networks (e.g. for image recognition) trained with the Caffe Deep Learning Framework (using this tool) but the long term goal is to support (perhaps with your help?) using deep learning models trained with the most popular Deep Learning frameworks (e.g. TensorFlow and Torch) as shown in figure below.
