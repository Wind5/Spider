signal processing in the brain. These models have dramatically improved the
networks, in large part because much of it was designed for von Neumann
both computational speed and energy efficiency. Here, we propose a new
of optics, promises a computational speed enhancement of at least two orders of
magnitude over the state-of-the-art and three orders of magnitude in power
