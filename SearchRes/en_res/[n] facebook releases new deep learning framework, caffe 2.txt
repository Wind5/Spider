 Caffe2 aims to provide an easy and straightforward way for you to experiment with deep learning and leverage community contributions of new models and algorithms. You can bring your creations to scale using the power of GPUs in the cloud or to the masses on mobile with Caffe2's cross-platform libraries.
 Try out our quickstart tutorials or jump in and start developing. Caffe2 comes with Python & C++ APIs so you can prototype now, easily optimize later. Use cloud services, Docker, or install on Mac, Windows, or Ubuntu. It integrates with Visual Studio, Android Studio, and Xcode for mobile development.
 One of the greatest things about Caffe is the vibrant community of developers and researchers that share their work in the Caffe model zoo. You can use these models to quickly build demo applications and explore deep learning capabilities without doing any time-consuming and resource-intensive training. You can recreate and evaluate the results from others' projects, hack together new uses, or improve upon the previously posted models.
 Deep learning and neural networks can be applied to any problem. It excels at handling large data sets, facilitating automation, image processing, and statistical and mathematical operations, just to name a few areas. It can be applied to any kind of operation and can help find opportunities, solutions, and insights.
