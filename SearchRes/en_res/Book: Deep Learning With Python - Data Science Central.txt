Jason Brownlee's Machine Learning Mastery materials are very good. He sells a bundle of material on topic such as Machine Learning, R, Python, Weka, and so on, which are cheaper if you buy the whole bundle. If he publishes something that is not part of the bundle, you get it a discount. At least that is what happened with me. Based on all the materials I have looked at over the last year, his materials are probably the best place to start along with DSC, of course.Thank you.
