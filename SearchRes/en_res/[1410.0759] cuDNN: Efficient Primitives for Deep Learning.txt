Abstract: We present a library of efficient implementations of deep learning
codebases difficult over time. Similar issues have long been addressed in the
HPC community by libraries such as the Basic Linear Algebra Subroutines (BLAS).
However, there is no analogous library for deep learning. Without such a
processors must create and optimize their own implementations of the main
computational kernels, and this work must be repeated as new parallel
processors emerge. To address this problem, we have created a library similar
in intent to BLAS, with optimized routines for deep learning workloads. Our
library, these routines could be implemented for other platforms. The library
performance and memory usage. For example, integrating cuDNN into Caffe, a
popular framework for convolutional networks, improves performance by 36% on a
