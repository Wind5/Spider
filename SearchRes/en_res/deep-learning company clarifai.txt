Then it shelled out $400 million for a secretive deep learning startup called DeepMind. Much like Facebook, Microsoft, and others, Google sees deep learning as the future of AI on the web, a better way of handling everything from voice and image recognition to language translation.But theres one notable deep learning company that Google hasnt yet bought. Its called Clarifai, and it may remain as an independent operation. Clarifai, you see, wants to open up some of the deep learning secrets used by Google, Facebook, and other companies and share them with the rest of the world.Clarifai specializes in using deep learning algorithms for visual search. In short, its building software that will help you find photos—whether theyre on your mobile phone, a dating website, or on a corporate network—and it will sell this software to all sorts of other companies that want to roll it into their own online services. "Were interested in making search through images simple," says founder Matthew Zeiler, a 27-year-old researcher, fresh out of New York Universitys computer science PhD program.Last year, along with NYU Professor Rob Fergus, Zeiler won a key image recognition test in a closely watched artificial intelligence competition called ImageNet. Fergus was soon snatched up by Facebook, and the big tech companies wanted to hire Zeiler too. But he had other plans.>'It's really defining your search in a visual way—not just in a text way.'
Over the past few years, theres been a major-league talent grab going on in the world of deep learning, which relies on computer models that simulate the way information is processed by the human brain. In addition to Fergus, Facebook hired another well-known academic named Yann LeCun. Baidu picked up Stanfords Andrew Ng, and Apple is building out a team too. The technology has already improved Androids voice recognition and helped Microsoft create a futuristic live voice translation system called Skype Translate. But Zeiler thinks that many others could benefit from deep learning.The trouble is, unless you have the money to hire your own deep learning experts, it can be hard to get the technology just right. The really difficult part is building learning models—essentially algorithms for processing all of the visual data—that work quickly across many different types of images. "To train these models is more of an art than a science," says Zeiler. "It takes a lot of years of experience." Thats where Clarifai comes in. Zieler has spent the past five years working with two of the biggest names in the field on this kind of learning model: Geoff Hinton—now at Google—and Facebooks Yann LeCun.The idea is that you can upload an image to the Clarifai software, and it will figure out whats in your picture and offer you more of the same. "Its really defining your search in a visual way—not just in a text way," says Zeiler.An example of how the software works, using an image of one of our favorite internet cats, Lil Bub.An example of how Clarifais software works, using an image of one of our favorite internet cats, Lil Bub.This could make Clarifais software appealing to businesses that own a large number of photographs but dont yet have a good way to search through them. "The number of images and videos coming online is increasing," says Max Krohn, a co-founder of the dating web site OKCupid. "So something has to make sense of all of that. And this idea that you just upload to Google and let them take care of that, its good for consumers, but its not good for enterprise or for some commerce plays." Krohn became an angel investor in Clarifai after checking out Zielers image searching demo late last year. Another investor: Google Ventures.Clarifai is developing an application program interface, or API, that will let software developers access its image search technology over the net. The company plans on licensing its software to corporate users—stock image companies, for example– and it also wants to build a consumer-grade app that could index and search the photos on your phone, much like Googles Photos app. Zeiler thinks it could be useful in e-commerce and targeted advertising too. "Lets say that youre walking down the street and you want to buy that dress that you see on some girl," he says. "Take a shot of it and we can instantly match it on all of the online stores."If you think that sounds like something that Google, Facebook, and even Amazon might be interested in, youre right. But Clarifai is not yet ready to get "serious about acquisitions," Zeiler says. For now, hes focused on other things. "We really want to get something out there that users are going to be able to use and benefit from."#EnterpriseMost PopulartransportationHurricane Harvey Destroys Up to a Million Cars in Driving-Dependent HoustonAuthor: Alex DaviesAlex DaviescultureJoel Osteens Hurricane Harvey Reaction Tops This Weeks News RoundupAuthor: Graeme McMillanGraeme McMillancultureYour Kids Will Look at Internet Porn.
